# This file holds the diseases for The Reaper's due, with all new values and effects
# note the "rip = yes" -- this will make it so that the disease is The Reaper's Due exclusive, so that we can have both versions of the disease
# if "rip" is not specified, the disease will be available in both version (with the same values in both) and doesn't need to be set twice

#put diseases in here later
