This is the list of error codes for the Validator.

# Applies to all games.

NEXT - ignores most errors from the following node, including ALL and other errors.
ALL - All errors listed below.
1000 - Since there is only one item within the AND clause, it is redundant and unnecessary.
1001 - The 'AND = { }' wrapper is unnecessary, since we are already within an 'and' clause.
1002 - Since there is only one item within the OR clause, it is redundant and unnecessary.
1003 - Having a factor of 1 is useless.
1004 - The string <string> was not found in localization.
1005 - The event is set to be triggered only, but it is never called.
1006 - XXX is not a valid YYY. (i.e. a TypeMismatchError)
1007 - Invalid node XXX (i.e. an InvalidChildError)
1008 - This triggered-only event should not have a MTTH.
1009 - ChildCountError i.e. "The required {0} entry was not found.", "There must be exactly one {0} entry, but {1} were found.", "At most {0} instance(s) of a {1} entry are allowed, but there are {2} instances.", "At least {0} instance(s) of a {1} entry are required, but there are only {2} instances."
1010 - Since there is only one item within the NAND clause, it is redundant and unnecessary.
1011 - The date ({0}) does not match the DateClause date ({1}).

# For CK2 and Sengoku
2000 - No birth found for character.
2001 - No death found for character.

# For CK2
3000 - Dynasty {0} is not connected, but has groups {1}
	NOTE: This must be applied to all characters in the dynasty, and should target the character ID.

# For EU4
Events.NoMtthOrIsTriggeredOnlyPresentCheck - Disables check that every event has `is_triggered_only = yes` or a `mean_time_to_happen` clause.

# For CK2 and EU4
EventTargets.NoEventTargetMismatchWarning - Disables messages such as "This event target {0} was inferred to have type {1} at {2} but here has type {3}" and "This event target {0} was inferred to have target type {1} at {2} but here has target type {3}". Useful if an event target has multiple scopes. Note that the validation of the scope may have false negatives if this ignore is used. It is generally better to have only one scope per event target.
EventTargets.NoUsersOfEventTarget - Disables messages such as "No users of this event target <target>". Note that you must put it on the setter mentioned in the error message for it to work. It is possible that the one mentioned in the error message might change between different runs of the Validator, in which case you would need to mark each one as it shows up.
