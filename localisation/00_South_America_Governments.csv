bureaucratic_government_desc;Bureaucracy is a form of government reminiscent of the Old World, that enshrines the values of meritocracy above all else. It's rulers are expected to take the ENEM exams, a way to prove their merit as rulers. Failure in the face of the test, or refusal to take it in the first place would cause rightful uproar amongst the ruling classes. Rulers are allowed to reorganize their realm, revoking Prefectural titles and retracting vassals, but otherwise are not allowed to imprison vassals or revoke their titles unless they have broken the law.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
