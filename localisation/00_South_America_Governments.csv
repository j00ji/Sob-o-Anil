bureaucratic_government;Governorate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
bureaucratic_government_desc;Governorate is a form of government reminiscent of the Old World, that enshrines the values of meritocracy above all else. It's rulers are expected to take the ENEM exams, a way to prove their merit as rulers. Failure in the face of the test, or refusal to take it in the first place would cause rightful uproar amongst the ruling classes. Rulers are allowed to reorganize their realm, revoking Governorural titles and retracting vassals, but otherwise are not allowed to imprison vassals or revoke their titles unless they have broken the law.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

military_government;Captaincy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
military_government_desc;The Captaincy is a form of government reminiscent of the Old World, a government that follows the core values of the militaries of old: strenght, hierarchy and meritocracy. Captaincy vassals particularly disprove of hereditary successions, preferring to choose their leader for his competency rather than for lineage. Rulers are allowed to reorganize their realm, revoking Governorural titles and retracting vassals, but otherwise are not allowed to imprison vassals or revoke their titles unless they have broken the law. Conscription camps may also be built on the correct sites.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

roman_imperial_government;Brazilian Imperial;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
roman_imperial_government_desc;Brazilian Imperial is a system upon which an Emperor employs the help of bureaucratic governors and military captains, in order to aid in the maintanence of a huge state. Thus, Brazilian Imperial realms live under a constant state of shifting power and politics: at times, the bureaucratic governors might be the most powerful class, dictating an inward focus on internal development, at others the Military might fulfill that role, leading to hawkish diplomacy and more focus into security, or to a balance between those two groups, benefitial to shrewd emperors wishing to take a more active role in the politics of the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

oligarchic_republic;Oligarchic Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
oligarchic_republic_desc;Under this system of government, a small group of the republic's citizens elect their leader from amongst themselves, with the leader ruling until their death. This system differs from the feudal system since it is not inherently hereditary. However, it often can become such due to corruption. It differs from a Merchant Republic since its main focus is not trade although it can partake in it..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
