bm_cono_sur_desc;The southernmost regions of South America were not spared the destruction wrought by the Event, though this end brought new beginnings for some. The Particularist Catholic Church struggles for power against new cults and a full-fledged indigenous revival in Patagonia, licking its wounds following the failure of the Platinean Crusade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bm_cordillera;Los Andes y el Pacifico;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bm_cordillera_desc;In the shadow of the Andes, change is the air. The authority of the Particularist Catholic Church has collapsed across the region, and new movements have emerged in the vacuum, inspired by ideas both old, like the Inkarri, and new, like the Liberationist heresy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

bm_terra_do_sol_desc;The north of Brazil around the Equator has seen centuries of disorder, torn asunder by zealots and warlords, but it recently became united under the rule of Fatima de Pelourinho, Empress of Brazil, only to be fractured again by the rise of Belchioringia. Only time will tell if the aspiring emperors will unite the region again or leave it forever divided.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

bm_cafe_com_leite_desc;The South has long been a center of power in Brazil, before and after the Event. The Years of Lead came first, later the Wars of the Schism, then the Mineiro Wars. Following the collapse of the Empire of Coffee and Milk, São Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Rio Grande do Sul are all divided, and the South is up for the taking once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

bm_inferno_verde_desc;The Amazon has long been impenetrable to outsiders, a green hell for armies and would-be conquerors. Life after the Event has brought isolation to the Amazon Basin, but life is not peaceful with patricians, prophets, and chiefs all vying for dominance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_NAME_DIEGO;Diego Bartales;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_230003;The son of the great Sword of Santiago, Diego Bartales participated in the Platinean Crusade five years ago, where he helped create the Platinean Crusader states and co-signed the Treaty of Buenos Aires alongside Procér Lionel Valle. Now that he has recently ascended to the kingship, Diego sees enemies, allies, and opportunities for expansion all around him. Will he manage to create a name for himself, or will he fail to live up to the legacy of his father?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

ERA_CHAR_NAME_ESTANISLAO;Lionel Valle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_330007;The Platinean hero cult has arisen as a rival of the Particularist Catholic Church since the Event, and Procér Lionel Valle of Buenos Aires has become the main patron of the Platineans, their protector and their hero. His victory in the Platinean Crusade against the crusaders won him much renown, and Lionel styles himself a gaucho and an intellectual, drawing a straight line between himself and the heroes of the past: San Martín - Rosas - Perón - Valle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_NAME_CRISTINA;Cristina Duarte;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_330016;During the Platinean Crusade, Duke Domingo Holgado of Junín was among the leaders of the Crusader army, but he was cut down by the Procér of Buenos Aires in battle. His widow, Cristina Duarte, fell into a state of grief and rage after Domingo’s death, only to emerge a wholly different woman. Cristina told all that she saw a vision of the Hand of God that chose her to overthrow the King of Buenos Aires and take the city back for the Particularist Catholic Church. Additionally, she has sworn a vow of celibacy until her husband’s murderer breathes his last, no matter the cost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_480008;It was Nahuel Quilapán’s father, Catriel the Morningstar, who united all of the Mapuche of Araucanía in the Araucanía Rebellion during the Fall of House Pincheira. Nizol Lonko Catriel took over the region and even conquered Biobío and Ñuble, but then died in a rebellion against his former squire Felipe Prat, leading to the split of Araucanía as a kingdom. Nahuel now seeks revenge against his father's killer and will do whatever it takes to do so, even if it means his family getting in the way of things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_810006;Bolivia, a land of silver, coca, and tin, has been united under the rule of its indigenous people and House Aiza, who liberated Quechua and Aymara alike from their slave masters and allowed them to rule themselves. In this land, El Tio and Pachamama reign supreme. King Andrónico Aiza has overseen the expansion of the Kingdom of Bolivia north and west, but cracks have begun to appear in the once idyllic Plurinational State…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_NAME_GERMAN;Germán Toro;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_810020;East of Bolivia, the Particular Catholic Church still holds a place of high reverence to the lords and the people. Duke Germán Toro of Cordillera looks at the state of Bolivia in disgust: Christian warlords in the east quarreling with one another and heathens in the west uniting around a demon-worshiping king. Unable to participate in the Platine Crusade, Germán has different ambitions: to finally end the division and heathenry in Bolivia and return the Cross to La Paz.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_NAME_CHASKA;Chaska Q’ollary;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_860100;When Pizarro conquered the Inca, the Spanish proceeded to wipe out all traces of Incan royalty and religion… or so they thought. There were the Q’ero people, the last living direct descendants of the Incas, who survived the Spanish conquest by receding high into the mountains and retaining their ancient worship of Inti. Long after the Event, the Q’ero returned from the mountains led by Chaska Q’ollary and retook Cuzco, the ancient Incan capital. Duke Chaska Q’ollary’s intentions to restore the Tawantinsuyu have been welcomed by many Quechua though the Inkarri call him a fraud, as Atahualpa has not yet returned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_860059;There have long been those who have rejected orthodoxies and forged their own paths in South America, not strictly indigenous and not strictly Catholic. Duke Alfanso Huaypacusi and his Chicheros are among those, reflecting on the death of the Old World by the birth of a new, better one. Alfanso would rather everyone just get along and get over their differences, to all sing together, but he knows that is not how the world works. Will the death song of the Pharaoh be one of sorrow or one of triumph then?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_860066;Lima has long been a center of the Particular Catholic Church, going back to even before the Event. It has also long been a center of inequality, with a tight grip over the trade and mining of Peru. It was against that inequality Feliciano Gutiérrez fought, armed with the greatest weapon of all: religion. Feliciano used his Liberationist preaching to rally an army of discontents and rebels around him, with which he toppled the old regime in Lima. Duke Feliciano Gutiérrez of Lima now rules in the name of the people, and there are many more oppressed who need to be liberated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_NAME_CELESTINO;Celestino Belchioringio;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_3;Antônio Carlos Belchior “the Great,” a commander in the Imperial armies under Empress Fátima de Pelourinho, established the Belchioringian Empire from Fátima’s dying empire and its ruinous Last Regency, extending his reach across the Northeast. Belchior’s death led to the fracture of Belchioringia and a civil war amongst his sons, with a peace finally being reached recognizing the eldest brother Celestino as the first among equals though they all ruled separate kingdoms. He rules over the most powerful of the Belchioringian realms, Cabo Norte, and it was Celestino who fought off the regency when they tried to retake the Northeast after Antônio died. King Celestino represents the interests of the coastal Candomblé elite of Belchioringia, and he hopes to one day reunite the Belchioringians, both to sate his own ambition and to stave off the imperialistic ambitions of Tristão I.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_NAME_FRANCISCO;Francisco Matildez;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_10001;The Seladite Rebellion of 2366 was a reaction against the naked favoritism shown by the Belchioringians towards the coastal elite at the expense of poorer Sertanistas and Cearenses. Francisco Matildez, a soldier turned firebrand preacher, led the masses against King Cláudio Belchioringio who he proclaimed to be an agent of communists and the Devil, and the rebellion was able to successfully drive the Belchioringians from Ceará. Francisco’s charisma, cunning and leadership led him to consolidating power as the ruler over both Sertanejas and Cearenses, with his capital centered around Fortaleza. King Francisco Matildez of Ceará looks both east and west, planning to both expand and surpass the feats of Antônio Carlos and even Fátima.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_NAME_TRISTAO;Tristão de Pelourinho;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_40010;Son of the great Fátima, Emperor Tristão de Pelourinho has a lot to live up to. His mother Fatima, empress and priestess of the Candomble religion, died when he was young, leaving him in the turbulent Last Regency under Eugênio Giordino. That regency saw the rise of the Belchioringians and the collapse of much of Fátima’s empire, leaving only a rump state in Bahia. However, Tristão has now come of age, and he is ready to retake what is rightfully his as the August Emperor. Will Brazil be reunited under his rule, or will it slip back into anarchy and civil war just as it did after Fátima’s?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_NAME_JOAO_ILHEUS;João Figueiredo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_40031;Once a commander of the Imperial armies under Empress Fátima de Pelourinho, João and his troops turned against her son, heading to Ilhéus, where he restored Ilhéus, naming himself as its monarch. As the territories that he captured were given to his officers, João I tried to take Salvador itself, a risky though bold move, that resulted in the destruction of his forces against Eugênio’s troops. Instead, João I recognized Tristão I as the August Emperor, and Eugênio recognized the sovereignty of João I Figueiredo of Ilhéus. The King and the Emperor now exist in an uneasy peace, João still resenting the young emperor for stifling his prior ambitions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_NAME_ROSA;Rosa Ribamar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_30016;When her father King José Ribamar of Maranhão died, Rosa only took up the crown reluctantly. She would have rather lived out a simple life without all the intrigue of the court, but duty called, as it always did. Her brother Zacarias was seen as too weak while her brother Francisco is hated by the nobility and is even considered too much of a threat by the rest of his family for his all-consuming ambition. Queen Rosa has her hands full dealing with the squabbling nobility of Maranhão and her brothers, and the weight of the crown has driven Rosa into a deep state of despair. Only time will tell if she will embrace the crown… or if it will consume her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_110001;The Empire of Coffee and Milk under Emperor Rodrigo Desterro came very close to uniting Minas Gerais and São Paulo under one ruler, only to be foiled when the would-be emperor tried to conquer the Principality of Americana. On the battlefield, Emperor Rodrigo met an enemy bandeirante named Alexandre Cantarini who proved to be his match with the Empire of Coffee and Milk collapsing after the emperor’s death. For his service in the Mineiro Wars, Alexandre was given the County of Campinas by the Governor of Grande São Paulo despite him being a Peterite heretic. Count Alexandre Cantarini now has put down roots and perhaps even ambitions, for São Paulo and beyond…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_NAME_YAGO;Yago Matarazzo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_300003;Vinicius was born of a union between House Taurer and House Rossi, Talian and Hunsruckisch, Evangelical and Celeste. His existence has always been precarious from his birth to his ascension after the death of his father in battle against the gaúcho hordes of Lorenzo Medici. The newly crowned King Vinicius Taurer of Planalto was therefore grateful when his sister Sophie avenged their father in battle, bestowing upon her many gifts and titles along with his brother Maltheus. However, the relationship between all three siblings has soured since their parents death for personal and sectarian reasons, particularly Sophie who believes her two brothers conspired together to steal what is rightful her’s: the crown. Vinicius, threatened by his siblings and gaúcho heathens, in response immersed himself completely into his Evangelical religion, and he has sworn to destroy the two greatest evils in the South: heresy and devil-worship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_110616;The Grand Dukes of Ribeira have a long and storied history as staunch allies of São Paulo, at least until the rule of Cosme II Cardoso. A traitor to his own people, Cosme II sided with the heathens of the Empire of Coffee and Milk against his fellow Paulistas and was the emperor’s most powerful ally until Rodrigo’s untimely death at Americana. A terror on the battlefield, Cosme II was horrifically scarred on the battlefield and returned to Ribeira a twisted mess of a man, excommunicated and filled with rage. Cosme II’s son Lucas Cardoso, coming of age while his father was away fighting in the Mineiro Wars, absconded from Registro with the family sword when it became clear his father had become a complete monster and raised a flag of rebellion against the Grand Duke. The future is always in motion, difficult to see who will triumph, the father or the son?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_NAME_CARLOS;Carlos Magno;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_110689;Minas is a kingdom in terminal decline, led by a drooling dullard with no clear heir. This was not always the case, however, and Carlos Magno de Ribeirão remembers it well. His natural father Emperor Rodrigo ruled the greatest empire on the continent after Fátima, ruling both Minas and São Paulo under the Empire of Coffee and Milk. Before his untimely death, many Benteiros even hailed Rodrigo as their final Messiah, the man who would end the chaos that has befallen the world after ‘A Derrama.’ Instead, many now see Rodrigo as a False Messiah who led Minas into ruin and his empire a doomed dream. Chief Carlos Magno de Ribeirão of Franca despises these men and has set out to prove them all wrong. He is not a Marginal Knight and his father was not a False Messiah: they will all see. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_860050;Isaiah 43:5 reads ‘Fear not, for I am with you, I will bring your offspring from the East, and from the West I will gather you.’ The Israelites of Peru have long held themselves to be the divinely-ordained gathering of Israel in the West under their prophets, new prophets for the new people of Israel. Enoch Ataucusi, a direct descendant of the Jesus of the West Prophet Ezequiel Ataucusi, believes that his body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit is telling him to reclaim the renewed Mount Sinai: Machu Picchu Mountain. For the first time in centuries, the Israelites are preparing to march out from their camps in Amazon towards Peru, to reclaim their holy places.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_NAME_ALBERTO;Alberto Santos;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_870015;The Republic of Manaus sits near the confluence of the Negro and Amazon rivers, and it has always been the largest population center in Amazonia. Jews, Christians, and the indigenous all rub shoulders in this city with most trade on the Amazon flowing through Manaus. Grand Mayor Alberto Casemiro of Manaus is an Amazonian Jew who maintains the precarious balance within the city and also fights off any outside enemies, mostly indigenous raiders. Alberto’s main concern at the moment is the Republic of Marajó, who is in direct competition with Manaus. A popular ruler with great ambitions, Alberto looks east: the Amazon is open for business.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_NAME_GIORDANO;Giordano Borges;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_870001;Higher wisdom has been a goal of many throughout history, and the religion of Santo Daime uses ayahuasca to reach a state of complete concentration. Giordano Borges was participating in such a ceremony in a cave after taking ayahuasca when he met a figure from the stars who gifted him with information about the internal workings of the universe, unfortunately it was in an unknown language. Giordano emerged from his ayahuasca trance with no wisdom but with new aspirations: to preserve the sovereignty of Acre, the spiritual center of Santo Daime, and to actually pursue worldly concerns.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_30018;At the mouth of the Amazon, Prince Zacarias Ribamar stews in his palace at Macapá. Conquered by Zacarias’ father José and his Fire Wasp comrades, Amapá’s Jewish rulers swore allegiance to Maranhão, and Zacarias gained the Duchy of Amapá after his father’s death, nominally still under the suzerainty of his sister Queen Rosa. Though not the brightest man, Zacarias knows he has many options and many avenues of expansion, and he intends to seize it. Will he forge west to conquer fellow Holy Spirit rulers on to Manaus, to subdue the Edah Amazonah in their nest? Will he push south to take on the Republic of Marajó and even Belém, the city that proved to be the doom of his father? Or will he make a move for the crown of Maranhão itself, even if it means war with his own sister? Only time will tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_NAME_KLAUS;Klaus de Aguirre;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_30018;The story of Klaus de Aguirre is one of madness and folly, a timeless tale of the lush but unforgiving Amazonian jungle. Setting out from Lima with his family and a larger expedition, Klaus was in search of the fabled country of El Dorado. The original leader of the expedition, Gonzalo de Ursúa, wanted to turn back after much of their supplies were lost in an eddy, but Klaus led a mutiny to forge deeper into the Amazon: Cortés won an empire in Mexico by disobeying orders after all! Klaus proved to be an oppressive and terrifying leader, consumed by his mad desire to find El Dorado. After the expedition was destroyed by attacks and starvation, it was whittled down to just him and his daughter. Klaus, driven past the point of madness, decided to abandon his quest to find El Dorado and instead settle down in the Amazon Rainforest with a new goal: conquering all of America and founding an incestuous dynasty to rule over it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
