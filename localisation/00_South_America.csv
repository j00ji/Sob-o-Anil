nguillatun;Nguillatun;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
nguillatun_DESC;The traditional faith of the Mapuche people, they believe that before the world was even formed, different primordial spirits, called the Ngen, Pillan, and Wangulén, came forth from the Pu-Am, the universal soul, and gave shape to all of creation through their own conflicts and stories. Now Ngenechén, the ruler spirit of mankind, blesses those that satisfy them with offerings in the Nguillatun ceremonies, and punishes those that fail to give worthy offerings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
xoon;Xo'on;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
xoon_DESC;Born from the revival of myths and cultures long lost in the south of the continent, led by the Xo'on shamans, they believe first and foremost in their supreme god, Temaulken, under him are the Ancestral Spirits, or Howenh. The Followers of the Xo'on also believe that, long ago, woman murdered the ancient spirits and ruled over man with an iron fist. The Sun Howenh, Kren, observed this oppression with rage, and so called for the Soortes, demons from the underworld that would bring back the natural order of things, so now men, with the assistance of the Soortes, would make sure that woman will never oppress man again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pachamama;Pachamama;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pachamama_DESC;The resurgence of the native spiritual beliefs, syncretized with traditional virgin devotion, and in conjunction with ecological and social movements of the past age before the Event, culminated in the ascendance of the cult of the Mother Earth, or Pachamama. As the source of life and the world we live in, mother of the Sun and the Moon and everything that is, Pachamamists believe that we must give offerings back to the World Mother in gratitude for everything she has given us, and caring for nature is caring for the gifts of the Goddess herself, thus protection of the land and living in harmony with it is the primordial duty of each person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jerovia;Añetejerovia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jerovia_DESC;The Guarani people have no written records of their ancient myths and legends, but these beliefs persist nonetheless as Añetejerovia. Tupã, the supreme god of all creation, with the help of the moon goddess Arasy, descended upon the Earth in a location specified as a hill in the region of Aregúa, Paraguay, and from that location created all that is found upon the face of the earth, including the ocean, forests, and the animals. Tupã then created humanity, left them with the spirits of good and evil, and departed. Añetejerovians also believe in certain animist traditions and the Pombéro, malicious goblin or elf-like spirits who dwell in the forest and must be appeased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
inti;Inti;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
inti_DESC;Inti is the ancient Incan sun god and the patron of the historical Inca state. Although most Inti worshippers consider him to be the sun god, he is also viewed as a cluster of solar aspects, since many divide his identity according to the stages of the sun. A common belief is that Inti was born of Viracocha, who had many titles, chief among them being the God of Creation. Worship of Inti has seen a revival following the Event, as many in the Andes see an opportunity to renew themselves and perhaps even reestablish the Realm of the Four Parts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
inkarri;Inkarri;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
inkarri_DESC;The faithful of Inkarri believe in the titular god, Inkarri, supreme and only deity that created and ruled the Andean world, taking the form of many Avatars through the ages, such as Viracocha, Inti, Manco Capac and others. When the evil and cruel Españarri came from a distant world, he struck down Inkarri's last Avatar, Atahualpa. Separating his body and limbs but keeping his head alive and buried, the power of Inkarri has been locked. Once his parts are finally reunited, Inkarri faithful believe that a new age will rise on the Andes with the return of their god, bringing back a Holy and Godly empire ruled by the newest incarnation of Inkarri.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hekura;Hekura;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hekura_DESC;Yanomami concepts of the soul are elaborate and sophisticated, multifaceted in fact. The most critical component of the soul is known as the moamo and lies inside the thoracic cavity, inside the liver. There is a close association the Yanomami make between “soul loss” and sickness is best exemplified in shamanistic practices. They spend several hours each day, if they are shamans, chanting to their tiny hekura spirits, enjoining them to either attack the souls of enemies or help them recover souls lost by people in their own village. This is a constant battle, and the men take hallucinogenic snuff daily to contest with their enemies through the agency of their personal hekura.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apostolic;Apostolic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apostolic_DESC;The Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church split from mainstream Catholicism long before the Event over disputes regarding divorce, anti-fascism, and clerical celibacy. Bishops are elected by popular vote, as is the president. Apostolics are also known for their relative religious tolerance of other Christian faiths and even other religions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
anchietican;Aparecidan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
anchietican_DESC;Aparecidans are heirs to the Catholic Church in Brazil, the predominant religion of the country for much of its history. Initially uniting under the Patriarch of South America and the Particularists, controversies surrounding the the Particularists openly sanctioning certain folk practices and disputes regarding the very existance of the Patriarchy led to many Brazilian bishops officially repudiating the authority of the Patriarch during the Council of Aparecida. Now effectively self-governing, Aparecidans claim to adhere more closely to the ancient traditions of the Catholic Church while still having influences from their own Brazilian folk traditions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
renewalist;Renewalist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
renewalist_DESC;Inspired by pre-event teachings, Renewalists are staunch believers in the values of the so-called 'Charismatic Renewal', such as great musical celebrations and the presence of spiritual gifts, also called charismas, as well as the belief that Layman should have a bigger role in Church life through dedication to the Pastorais. Their customs have placed them at odds with other Catholics, with many of their practices being denounced as heretic and syncretic in nature, and Renewalists in turn decrying the rest of the clergy for abandoning the values of the so-called 'Ancestral Church' and claiming to be the real successors of the Church.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
renewalist_FEATURES;§Y*§! Renewalists might go on vision quests, Adorations of the Holy Spirit. \n§Y*§! Renewalists characters must join one of the Pastorais.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
iconoclasts;Iconoclast;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
iconoclasts_DESC;Iconoclasts represent a reaction against what they perceive as idolatry within both the Particularists and Anchietans. Issues of folk traditions and canonization of local saints split the Anchietans from the Particularists, but the Iconoclasts claim that the Anchietans are still in error for their widespread acceptance of certain folk traditions that have "pagan origins". Iconoclasts view any form of syncretism as abomination, destroying it where they can, and they await their vindication with the return of contact with Rome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
peterite;Peterite;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
peterite_DESC;The Peterite movement was born following the chaos of the Event and the uncertainty brought on by the schism between Catholics in Brazil and elsewhere, faced with a crisis of authority.  The first Peterites emerged due to the twin discoveries of ancient documents declaring the faithful should be led by a protective secular authority, the Padroado, and the writings of saints declaring Peter II, the last Emperor of Brazil, to also be the last legitimate Pope of the Church. Endorsed by a seemingly divine mandate, on the authority of The Magnanimous, Peterites ultimately seek to restore the Brazilian Empire as the new Rome for the Catholic church.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orthodoxist;Byzantine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
orthodoxist_DESC;The Byzantine Rite represents the liturgical and canonical practices that developed in the Eastern Christian Churches and were incorporated within the Catholic church. Byzantines practice the rite in the original Greek or some other form (Slavic, Romanian, Hungarian, Albanian). After the Event and the resulting loss of contact with Rome, Byzantines have become more insular, shunning the authority of new non-Papal institutions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
liberationist;Liberationist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
liberationist_DESC;Based on the teachings of Liberation Theology, Liberationists propose to fight poverty and misery by addressing its alleged source, the sin of greed, that they denounce at every chance. They believe that the ancient hierarchies have been corrupted by this sin, and led the church stray from God's path. Thus it's only through base church communities, where self-reliant worshipers from amongst the common people will return the church closer to the early uncorrupted gospel. Some of the more radical Liberationists even believe that it's this plight of greed that led to the Event, as society went Godless and the natural order was broken.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cicerite;Cicerite;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cicerite_DESC;The Cicerites take inspiration from Father Cícero, a Catholic priest who was a spiritual leader to the people of Northeastern Brazil who was accused of heresy in his time. Father Cícero was given a dream where Jesus said that he was upset with humanity, but that he was still willing to do the last sacrifice to save the world if men repented and the poor were taken care of. As a result, the Cicerites put great emphasis on helping others, changing the immoral customs of the people, and getting rid of excessive drunkenness, prostitution, and other sinful practices. They also have great respect for mystics and miracle workers, as Father Cícero was.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
seladite;Seladite;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
seladite_DESC;During his lifetime, Father Cicero made many prophecies about the future including those about the End of Days. The spread of false religions and tyranny across the world and the Event itself signal to the Seladites that the first four of the Seven Seals of God have been opened. As such, Seladites believe firmly that they are living in the End Times, and soon, there will be judgment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evangelical;Evangelical;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
evangelical_DESC;Following the Event, representatives of various Protestant churches from across South America met in Rio de Janeiro and established a General Convention of Evangelicals to protect themselves from other encroaching faiths. In this way, Evangelicals recognize and respect theological differences of congregations while still standing as one united Protestant church. Their communion however remains fragile, and interference by outsiders may bring it to collapse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
universal;Neo-Pentecostal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
universal_DESC;The Neo-Pentecostals are perhaps the most notable Protestant group to shun the General Convention of the Evangelicals, citing irrevocable differences such as the convention's lack of drive to transform the church into the Kingdom of God on earth. Neo-Pentecostals also felt Evangelicals did not take a strong enough stance against "enemies of the faith" such as Catholics and syncretic religions such as Umbanda and Candomblé. In response, Evangelicals destroyed the "idolatrous" Temple of Solomon in São Paulo and expelled the Neo-Pentecostal leadership from the city. Since then, the Neo-Pentecostals have been rebuilding, preaching, and receiving tithes as it always has.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tridentine;Tridentine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tridentine_DESC;Called Tridentines due to the prominence of the ancient Tridentine Mass in the faith, the Tridentines follow what they consider to be the truest, most traditional, and most unchanged form of Christianity. Originating from traditionalists within the Catholic Church, Tridentines believe the Event was punishment, divine retaliation for those who strayed from the Lord's true path, and that it culminated with the assumption of His Holiness, the last Vicar of Christ, into the heavens, leaving the Earth with no successor behind. Tridentines believe they live in a time of Great Tribulation, and that all others, even other Christians, live in error. Therefore, it is the Tridentine's obligation to engage in holy war against all heathens and heretics, to make way for the return of His Holiness and the Second Coming soon after.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mysticalist;Mysticalist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mysticalist_DESC;Mysticalists differ from Tridentines in that they believe the Vicar of Christ will return long before the Second Coming, in fact he has already returned several times. This system, based on personal mystical revelation, claims that the ability to choose Popes has been stripped from human institutions and now only God himself may decide. Although not as aggressive as Tridentines, Mysticalists still practice the Tridentine Mass and regard other Catholics (and indeed all other Christians) as living in error.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
holy_spirit;Holy Spirit;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
holy_spirit_DESC;The Cult of the Holy Spirit originated from the ideas of the prophet Joachim: the Old Testament was the Age of the Father, the recent past was the Age of the Son, and the current is the Age of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit cultists advocate an Order of the Just, separate from any mainstream church. Rituals such as the império, the coronation, and the ceia dos criadores are considered to be of great importance in showing one's devotion to the Holy Spirit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
xabaxai_xagi;Xabaxáígio Xagí;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
xabaxai_xagi_DESC;Xabaraxáígio Xagí combines the Cult of the Holy Spirit and indigenous beliefs, earning it the enmity of many more staunch members of the cult. The Holy Spirit is considered to manifest in the material world, sometimes taking on the shape of things in the environment such as jaguars, trees, or other visible, tangible things including people. Warding off evil spirits is also considered to be on uptmod importance by Xabaraxáígio Xagí adherents as a matter of survival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
catholic;Particularist;;;;;;;;;;;;;
catholic_DESC;Particularists are heirs of the once by far dominant faith of the continent, the Catholic Church which was battered by the chaos and the change brought by the Event. In need of greater unity and direction than ever, a union of archbishops from across South America put aside their political differences and united as a sui iuris particular Catholic Church and elected a Patriarch of South America to lead them. Originally based in Buenos Aires, the Brazilian schism and the rise of other faiths weakened the Patriarchy, eventually leading to its displacement to Santiago. While Particularists have maintained traditional Catholic Latin rites, traditional folk practices have deeply permeated it. The autonomous ecclesiastical leadership has sanctioned many of its local saints as canonical, contributing to the tensions and eventually schism with the church in Brazil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cult_of_saints;Vernacular;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chicha;Chicha;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chicha_DESC;Chicha originates not from theologians or prophets but the musicians and common people of Peru. Chicheros derive their beliefs from Christianity but have a deep focus on love, the inequality of exploitation, and community. The relationship between life and death is also a focal point of Chicha, with death rituals being of great importance. Chichero musicians are given similar respect as clergy, with the roles even intersecting at times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
santa_diablada;Santa Diablada;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
santa_diablada_DESC;Born from the clash between worlds, Las Santas Diabladas are a diverse and vibrant clade of cults that have arisen in the Central Andes, believing that under God there is a wide pantheon of powerful beings composed by Saints, Demons, and Spirits of the Land, that either in awe and admiration or in fear, must be worshipped and kept content, otherwise they might sway from blessing into cursing those who don't give them the offering they seek and deserve. As rival interests and domains between the forces exist, Santa Diablada worshippers identify with one of three large groups. Los Santos, followers of Jesús, the Virgin, San Ernesto and El Tata. Los Diablos, followers of dark demons like El Tío, Ekeko, Momo and even Mandinga. And Los Dueños, followers of the spirits of nature, like Jichi, Coquena and Jerere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
folclorista;Folclorista;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
folclorista_DESC;The folk saint Gaucho Gil has long held significance to the Catholic faithful in Argentina and beyond. Conscripted twice into wars he did not want to fight, Gil decided to desert and become a bandit, robbing the rich and giving to the poor. Gil was eventually captured and his throat cut but not before telling his executioner that he should pray on Gil's behalf for the life of his son, who was very sick. The son was cured, and word of Gaucho Gil spread far and wide. Though many venerate Gil, the Folcloristas see him as the penultimate martyr who gave his life for the good of all mankind. The tradition of wrapping red flags or painting red the shrines of veneration to Gauchito Gil is observed by many Folcloristas, who often go on pilgrimages to such shrines to remember the martyr's sacrifice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
patria_grande;Patria Grande;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
patria_grande_DESC;The term Patria Grande, or Great Fatherland, is to its followers both a political ideal and a divine mandate. The adherents of the faith worship the heroes of the past who liberated and ruled the original Patria Grande, bringing what they consider a golden age. As a result the faithful aspire to see the legendary homeland unified once more. Their pantheon is made up of "próceres", deities originated from the syncretism between the founders of Gran Colombia and several Catholic saints.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
syncretic_group;Syncretic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camdomble;Candomblecist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camdomble_DESC;Candomblé is a syncretic faith that absorbed religious traditions from West Africans, Portuguese Catholics, and the indigenous. Its name literally means "dance in honor of the gods," and many of its rituals involve music and dance. Practitioners worship a creator deity named Olodumaré, as well as numerous lesser spirits called Orixás. Candomblé practitioners believe that every person has their own patron Orixá, who controls their destiny and acts as a spiritual protector.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
santo_daime;Santo Daime;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
santo_daime_DESC;Santo Daime is a syncretic religion founded in the Brazilian region of Acre by Mestre Irineu. The religion incorporates elements of several religious or spiritual traditions including Catholicism, Kardecist beliefs, African animism, and indigenous shamanism, including vegetalismo. Ceremonies, trabalhos, are and are undertaken sitting in silent "concentration", or sung collectively, dancing according to simple steps in geometrical formation. Ayahuasca is drunk as part of the ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
umbanda;Umbanda;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
umbanda_DESC;Umbanda is a syncretic religion that blends African traditions with Catholicism, Spiritism, and Indigenous beliefs. The religion originated in Niterói due to the work of a psychic, Zélio Fernandino de Moraes, who practiced Umbanda among poor Brazilians. Other common beliefs are the existence of deities called Orixás, most of them syncretized with Catholic saints that act as divine energy and forces of nature, spirits of deceased people that counsel and guide practitioners through troubles in the material world, psychics, or mediums, who have a natural ability that can be perfected to bring messages from the spiritual world of Orixás and the guiding spirits, reincarnation and spiritual evolution through many material lives, and the practice of charity and social fraternity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kardecists;Kardecist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kardecists_DESC;There has been debate as to whether Kardecism is a philosophy or a religion, but Kardecists take their beliefs very seriously irregardless. Based on the writings of Allan Kardec on a study of mediums, Kardecist doctrine advocates the Triple-Aspect: the conjoining of Science, Philosophy, and Religion. Kardecists believe that all living beings are essentially immortal spirits that inhabit physical bodies only for several necessary incarnations to attain moral and intellectual improvement. Kardecism also asserts that disembodied spirits, through passive or active mediumship, may have beneficent or malevolent influence on the physical world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
eastern_group;Eastern;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
buddhism;Buddhist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
buddhism_DESC;Buddhism is a religion based on a series of original teachings attributed to Gautama Buddha. As expressed in the Buddha's Four Noble Truths, the goal of Buddhism is to overcome suffering caused by desire and ignorance of reality's true nature, including impermanence and the non-existence of the self. Buddhist traditions emphasize transcending the individual self through the attainment of Nirvana or by following the path of Buddhahood, ending the cycle of death and rebirth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
theosophist;Theosophist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
theosophist_DESC;Theosophists are the followers of the Ascended Masters, beings that shepherd the spiritual and intellectual development of humanity. According to their teachings, it was when the world closed their hearts to the lessons of the Ascended Masters that mankind grew distant from Nature and Truth relying more and more upon false religions before the Old World collapsed under the burden of ignorance and desire that it carried upon its back. Numerous legends hold that a Lord Maitreya will emerge to transfer knowledge about the true constitution and workings of Existence to humankind. The Theosophists de-emphasize the importance of organized religious scripture, ritual, and hierarchy as a source of direct enlightenment, viewing them simply as roads for every individual to access the source of Truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hindu;Hindu;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hindu_DESC;Hinduism is not a single religion so much as a blanket term for the successor faiths of ancient Indian polytheism as recorded in the Vedas. Post-Event Hinduism differs radically from pre-Event Hinduism in several key ways. For example, the vast majority of Hindus now reject the caste system, believing instead that all humans are spiritually equal. Proselytization towards non-Hindus has also become more common.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
old_world_cultists;Old World Cultist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino_estelar;Camino Estelar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino_estelar_DESC;Born from the synthesis of different UFO cults, Andean myths and geoglyphs, and the influence of Astronomy, Camino Estelar believes that the Event was actually written in the stars, a cosmic punishment for not following the celestial instructions. It's through star-reading and observation that they can follow the path of the Hermanos Mayores or Elder Siblings, also known as the Annunaki, all-mighty beings from far amongst the stars, led by the sacred master Nibiru. They revere the ruins of the old observatories and astronomical facilities as holy places where they regularly pilgrim to, crossing the desert and reaching these far temples where they can communicate with the stars. Ancient geoglyphs are also regarded as messages to the gods, and a way of asking for guidance and blessings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
obscurantist;Obscurantist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
obscurantist_DESC;Born from a different interpretation on the Camino Estelar myths, Obscurantists believe that although it's true that mighty beings are found amongst the stars, and through observation they can be reached, they believe those being are harbingers of the end, lead by the World Born Dead, Nibiru,and the Event was caused because mankind looked too deep into the Abyss beyond the world. To prevent anything like that to ever happen again, they seek to destroy any chance of people finding what the people of old ever found, and hide any secrets the stars hide, as keepers of what must not be known. It is only under the cover of Darkness, that Humankind will be safe from the Shining Abyss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
modernists;Architecturalist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
modernists_DESC;Architecturalists believe that the Great Architect in coalition with the Old Masters had planned the lead that came, in order to purify the world for a new beginning. Through following the laid out plans of the old masters and coming to important places of worship where Innovation concentrates, Architecturalists believe they will manage to build towards a greater post-collapse glory and restore a greater existence for everyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
varedesian;Varedesian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
varedesian_DESC;While most Modernists look for the past once lost or a future never achieved, the Varedesians, followers of Master Guimarães and Master Graciliano, have learned through their legends that enlightenment exists in the living present and its fundamental conflicts and dualities. Life is both blessing and curse, joy and suffering, reality and magic, and those who understand this shall live truthfully. Men live and die following these teachings, often without even knowing it, but Varedesians embrace these seemingly contradictory dualites with gusto.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
anthropofagian;Anthropofagian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
anthropofagian_DESC;Anthropofagians are followers of the Manifesto, and know that Innovation entrenches itself deep into the Human Condition, due to this, they believe that ritual consumption of other men and woman will bring people into a deeper and more cohesive understanding and will make them able to control and manage Innovation. As outlined by the Old Masters, they believe that the consumption of other cultures is deeply valuable for such goals, as their Innovation only serves to strengthen theirs and come to a better understanding of other cultures.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
aphite;Posadist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
aphite_DESC;Posadists believes in Atomos similarly to Atomicists, but their theology and practices radically differ in various ways. Mosts prominently, Posadists believe that Atomos will one day return to the material world, as predicted by the prophet Posadas, and he will usher in a utopian world of justice and fairness after cleansing the Earth of the evils of the Capitalist and the Men in Black. These millenarian views have separated them from mainstream Atomicists, and Posadists remain eager to wage holy war themselves in anticipation of the World Revolution, the return of Atomos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
atomicist;Atomicist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
atomicist_DESC;Atomicists believe that the god Atomos created the world in a vast explosion of energy, and that he inhabits an invisible plane of energy that intersects with the material world. In the days of yore, men could tap into this intangible world and use the gifts of Atomos to become gods themselves. Atomicists seek to relearn the secrets of that past age so that they too can unlock the power of the atom. However, Atomos does not always take kindly to those who try to harness his power...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
platinean;Platinean;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
platinean_DESC;Sovereignty of the people is the principle that guides Platineans, as it has for centuries, and the conviction that there will be those who rise to defend Sovereignty. After the Crown created the Río de la Plata and slipped into tyranny, the Libertador San Martín crossed the Andes to fight for the salvation of not just the Río de la Plata but all of South America. After San Martín came great chaos and the tyranny of Rosas but eventually Perón arose, building the three pillars to support the people. He too eventually ascended, but the Platineans still hold him (and his wife) in equal regard to San Martín. Even today, Platineans pray for another who may be embodiment of nationality and defend Sovereignty, just as in the past.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
rosalian;Rosalian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
rosalian_DESC;Rosalians share similar ideas about Sovereignty as Platineans but differ sharply on the figures they worship. Rosalians hold that San Martín handed his sword, symbolizing the sum of public power, over to Rosas, establishing him as the rightful Restorer who then governed wisely and with great virtue. Rosas was later betrayed by jealous usurpers, and this ended the former Golden Age, at least according to Rosalians. Meanwhile, Platineans view Rosas as a brutal tyrant and his ascendancy as totalitarian. Rosalians pray for another Rosas, a Restorer that could restore Sovereignty and Virtue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bandean;Bandean;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bandean_DESC;The Banda Oriental has been a cradle of peace, justice, and progress ever since its establishment by the Thirty Three Immortals, Libertadors who succeeded where Artigas failed. The Bandeans see the Thirty Three Immortals as the physical representatives of the Banda Oriental, ushering in the antediluvian Age of Reason, and they aspire to fight for their rights just as their Libertadors did.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
artiguista;Artiguista;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
artiguista_DESC;Artiguistas revere Banda Oriental akin to Bandeans, but they contend that Artigas was the true Libertador, not the Thirty Three Immortals, establishing the Age of Reason. According to Artiguistas, Artigas was betrayed by Platineans in his hour of need, leading to the Oriental exodus. The Thirty Three Immortals, then acting as Platinean puppets, swept in to take credit for the liberation themselves. Artiguistas are also staunch believers in the Enlightenment, valuing equality, liberty, and the preservation of those values.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
piriamano;Piriamano;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
piriamano_DESC;Piriamano posits that the Banda Oriental desires achievement rather than war, as expressed by their idol Piria. It holds Piria to have been the primary physical representative of the Banda Oriental, as shown by his great achievements in building and other legendary feats throughout his life. As such, Piriamanos seek to imitate Piria to gain the favor of the Banda Oriental and jealously guard Piria’s creations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
farrapo;Farroupilha;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
farrapo_DESC;Farroupilha is a religion of gauchos and revolutionaries, forged in the crucible of war. The Farroupilhas, led by Gonçalves, fought for freedom, the abolition of slavery, and democracy. Their war would be lost, then won, then lost again, with the death of democracy and the end of that Golden Age. Farroupilhas now aspire to live as their ancestors did, as revolutionaries, free to live as they please worshiping the gods of their gaucho forefathers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vargist;Getulist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vargist_DESC;Getulism recalls a revolution far more successful than that of the Farroupilha, led by one named Getulio. Getulio brought true revolution to all of Brazil, not just one region, as an expression of the collective will against wicked oligarchy. His Estado Novo saw Brazil reach the apex of its power, as he destroyed enemies within and without, including the gauchos. Even the death of Getulio, his sacrifice and his ascension, thwarted the efforts of his enemies to stem his revolution, so beloved was he. Getulists desire a return to the days of the Estado Novo, when Brazil was guided by a strong hand, and they are confident that Getulio Vargas guides them now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
darwinist;Darwinist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
darwinist_DESC;Darwinists follow the teachings of the wise and ancient Prophet Darwin, they believe that Mother Nature is supreme in all of her doings, and that she shall select each one's path upon this world through Evolution, and lead those who aren't meant to be to Extinction. Darwinists also venerate the great and majestous creatures and living beings that Mother Nature blessed the lands with and strongly reject the ideals of forcing the environment to follow the nefarious anthropocentric needs, for only Nature's will must be supreme.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lamarckian;Lamarckian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lamarckian_DESC;Lamarckians are the followers of Father Lamarck, Vile Darwin’s greatest rival. They reject the idea that Mother Nature will decide their fate and keep mankind enslaved to her will, instead, they preach that their own effort will lead to mankind’s ultimate development and rise over the wild. They worship Ortho Genesis, the god of Mankind, and Lord of the Driving Force, the divine grace of self-development, and the power behind everything good in society, instead of capricious Nature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
calafatist_reformed;Calafatist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
calafatist_reformed_DESC;The Calafate is a hardy berry plant, a symbol of Patagonia and so much more for Calafatists. Calafatist paganism refers to the series of myths and beliefs developed by the people at the southernmost frontier of the continent. The Calafatists believe that after the event the world reached a new age, but two ages came past, the age of the Giants, lead by Nosjthej, and the age of the Explorers, lead by Magellan. Together, these forces stood their ground against the vile cold from the south, until the ice shattered and the new age began, awith the descendants of both following their path and gaining strength from reclaiming their old power, they are known for their ritual consumption of calafate berries, said to contain the essence of the great female spirit Calafate, whose sacrifice to keep standing cold’s greatest strike gives them strength to remain unyielding against everything and always come back to the frontier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

terra_benta_reformed;Benteiro;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
terra_benta_reformed_DESC;Benteiros venerate the sacred mountains and hills of Minas Gerais, in addition to various virtuous men and women of the past. They perceive this material world as a single chapter within an unending cycle of death and rebirth, marked by a catastrophic incident called 'A Derrama', followed by the salvation of all righteous souls and the subsequent recreation of existence from the curdling of a primordial Chaos. Benteiros now eagerly expect the final coming of the Messiah, who will sacrifice himself in an attempt to end the cycle of cataclysms, as past figures like Tomás Dirceu, Tancredo and Tiradentes once did. However, their plans and prayers may be thwarted by the malevolent Emboabas and their False Messiahs, the evil beings responsible for the latest and more destructive Derrama, which ravaged the Old World six centuries ago. Consequently, Benteiros adhere to the 'Inconfidência', abstaining from sharing the most intimate and secretive aspects of their liturgies and rituals with outsiders and non-believers..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
terra_benta;Benteiro;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
terra_benta_DESC;Benteiros venerate the sacred mountains and hills of Minas Gerais, in addition to various virtuous men and women of the past. They perceive this material world as a single chapter within an unending cycle of death and rebirth, marked by a catastrophic incident called 'A Derrama', followed by the salvation of all righteous souls and the subsequent recreation of existence from the curdling of a primordial Chaos. Benteiros now eagerly expect the final coming of the Messiah, who will sacrifice himself in an attempt to end the cycle of cataclysms, as past figures like Tomás Dirceu, Tancredo and Tiradentes once did. However, their plans and prayers may be thwarted by the malevolent Emboabas and their False Messiahs, the evil beings responsible for the latest and more destructive Derrama, which ravaged the Old World six centuries ago. Consequently, Benteiros adhere to the 'Inconfidência', abstaining from sharing the most intimate and secretive aspects of their liturgies and rituals with outsiders and non-believers..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
gaucheria_reformed;Gaucheria;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
gaucheria_reformed_DESC;Gauchos have been present in the Pampas since time immemorial, brave and unruly as the land itself. Gaucheria is the code and the folklore of the gaucho, setting itself apart from the revolutionary rhetoric of Farroupilha with its simplicity. The tendency to violence over petty matters is recognized as the behavior of a proper gaucho, and duels are common. Their gods are many but largely irrelevant compared to the practices attached to the religion such as cattle-herding, horsemanship, and ritualized violence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dreamtime_reformed;Piogonak;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dreamtime_reformed_DESC;The ancestral Qom religiosity or Piogonak is based on the belief in a supreme being and in a complex of animals and cultural heroes. The requests and prayers are related to the interactivity of man with nature: the water, the mountains, the sky, the moon, the sun, the stars, the wind and with the superior beings that inhabit these natural elements. This all stems from creation itself and the following union of animal-men with star-women. Shamans are considered an important element of Piogonak, giving offering to deities such as the cannibal woman NsoGoi and the Rainbow Serpent Mogonaló.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

manredebu_reformed;Manredebu;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
manredebu_reformed_DESC;Adherents of Manredebu have a cosmology centering around the enternal conflict and fusion of humanity below the All-Father Sun, using animalistic symbols, such as cattle, horses, ants, and anteaters. Followers form bonds and do dances based on events of cosmic signifance. According to believers, this ties into the great conflict of life and afterlife and this is necessary for the functioning of the universe as a whole, one day through it salvation will come to all followers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

brethren;Brethren;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
brethren_DESC;With a strong tradition of seafaring and a reputation for robbery and murder, most call the Brethren pirates. This assessment is not far from the truth. Though the Brethren follow a Code of the Sea, they are loosely organized and live mostly to plunder riches from the weak. All of their gods have some link to the ocean, which they consider the source of all life and all wealth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
conservante;Quietista;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
conservante_DESC;The Event led to persecution of Muslims across South America, but not everyone responded to this persecution with increased militancy. Adhering broadly to Sunni jurisprudence, Quietistas do not believe that the Islamic religion and politics are inseparable. Humans are prone to errors or corruption, therefore no mortal human can ever establish a just, Islamic rule on Earth. This mostly means that the supreme role of sharia and the use of offensive warfare are deemphasized by Quietistas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
angel_cult;Arcanjo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
angel_cult_DESC;The Arcanjos believe that the divine is all around them, with many spirits coming from two antagonic supernatural realms, The Heavens and The Abyss. Both of these realms seek to court Man to their side, and Man can communicate and make contracts with these entities through special rituals in order to receive aid in achieving their goals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazonian_jews;Edah Amazonah;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
amazonian_jews_DESC;Amazonian Jews, also known as Edah Amazona, descend from Moroccan Jews who came to the Amazon Basin long before the Event. Those who stayed married indigenous Amazonian women, and their children have grown up in a culture of Jewish and Christian, and Moroccan and Amazonian influences. Santo Moisézinho is remembered as a folk saint within the community, and his grave is the common site of pilgrimage, even for non-Jews.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
celeste;Celeste;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
celeste_DESC;Celestes believe the spirit of Christ descended upon a series of local messainic figures from Southern Brazil, who guided His people to purity in the New World and against the deviant heretics who'd wish them exterminated. Celestes worship many messainic figures, such as José María, Theodora, and Maria Rosa, among others. They believe that these figures were blessed with divine visions, and thus have been chosen by divine providence to lead them in the so-called "celestial communities". Celestes often take inspiration from Old World traditions such as chivalry and chastity, shunning earthly pleasures and inflicting heavy punishment on deviants and enemies of the faith. Nevertheless, they often mix esoteric and mystic elements into their Christian doctrine, and Celestes tend to greatly respect healers and miracle workers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
herderos;Frontera;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
herderos_DESC;After the Event, Muslims in South America faced sectarian violence as did many other religious groups. This persecution often crystalized the Muslim community into those who resisted and those who died, with many surviving Muslims gathering in the Triple Frontier where they already lived in large numbers. Fronteras largely adhere to Shia jurisprudence and put a heavy emphasis on reverence to the Ahl al-Bayt and the eventual emergence of the Mahdi, who shall one day return on Earth and fill the world with justice. Until then, Fronteras adhere to Wilayat al-faqih or the Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
imamite;Imamite;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
imamite_DESC;Refusing to abandon the world around them in the wake of the event, the Imamites held onto their beliefs while also adapting to become a cosmopolitan faith. Unlike Traditionalists who focus inwards to preserve themselves, Imamites strive to build a place for themselves amongst the outside world, instead of isolating themselves from it for safety. The Imamites are guided by the Supreme Islamic Majlis, and are named Imamites because of the leader of the Majlis, the head Imam. They await Imam Mahdi's coming, and the corresponding deliverance of freedom and justice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mucker;Mucker;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mucker_DESC;The Muckers base their beliefs on Jacobina Mentz Maurer, who they see as a manifestation of God and a reincarnation of Jesus Christ. Jacobina's message was millenarian, denouncing modernism and Catholicism. The ideal community of the Muckers is one that shares its resources with collective ownership, and one that exterminates all those who oppose His will. Muckers put much stock in trances and visions, taking them as important messages from the Holy Spirit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
traditionalist;Traditionalist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
traditionalist_DESC;The Traditionalist community descends from pre-event Muslims, both Shiites and Sunni, banding together and setting aside minor differences to survive the trauma of the event together. Traditionalists focus inwards, seeking to preserve their traditions and beliefs to not forget where they came from while the world changes around them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
valentes;Denunciadora;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
valentes_DESC;Muslims in South America faced sectarian violence as did many other religious groups after the Event, leading to many retreating into further radicalism to deal with enemies both within Islam and outside it. Denunciadoras or "denouncers" adhere to an extreme form of Sunni jurisprudence where those who do not stringently enforce sharia or are otherwise deemed insufficiently religious are not considered Muslims at all. This does not always lead to violence but it often does with the ones deemed "apostates" and indeed other non-Muslims, as Denunciadoras believe Islam to the supreme law of the land with no other being acceptable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
israelite;Israelite;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
israelite_DESC;Israelites, also known as the Israelites of the New Universal Pact, were founded by Brother Ezequiel, a prophet who called himself the Christ of the west and preached that he was chosen by God to create a new Israel in the Amazon Rainforest as a punishment of the original Israelites for their losing faith. The Israelites seek to establish a truly godly society on Earth with influences from Chrisitanity, Judaism, and Incan religion to live up to Brother Ezequiel’s vision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sebastianist;Sebastianist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sebastianist_DESC;The world has been godless for a long time, but it was not always so. Once, there ruled Brazil two kings, Sebastian and Dom Pedro, equal in wisdom and both pre-ordained by God to rule. They jointly ruled the Fifth Empire, the closest to Paradise man has come since Eden. However, the kings eventually disappeared, first Sebastian lost in battle and second Dom Pedro in exile, and the world has been gripped by chaos and division ever since. Now, Sebastianists pray for a swift return of the kings, one or both, and peace to the world. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
johrei;Johrei;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
johrei_DESC;Founded by Okada Mokichi, Johrei is the practice of channeling divine light into the body of another for the purposes of healing. Okada claimed to have received a divine revelation that empowered him to be a channel of God's Healing Light or johrei to purify the spiritual realm to remove the spiritual causes of illness, poverty, and strife from the world and inaugurate a new Messianic Age. Johrei practitioners see Okada as the Messiah, and he claimed to teach his followers how to achieve Messianity themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jurema;Juremeiro;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jurema_DESC;The Jurema is a collection of rituals and magics of the indigenous peoples of Northeast Brazil, its practitioners, the “juremeiros” hold devotion to the spirits of the land, the “encantados”, and their sacred ancestors, the “caboclos de jurema”, and praise them with songs and circular dances, the smoking of tobacco and the ingestion of the herbs and plants to commune with this spirits and ancestors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tambor;Tambor de Mina;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tambor_DESC;Tambor de Mina, an Afro-Brazilian religion originating in Maranhão, stands as a testament to a vibrant blend of culture and spirituality. Built upon the reverence for the Encantandos, Egunguns, Vodouns and Orixás, spiritual entities embodying natural elements and human traits, this religious practice is distinguished by its profound connection to music and dance, employing drums to establish a link with the divine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
rastafarian;Rastafari;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
rastafarian_DESC;Rastafari is a religion originating in Jamaica, inspired by both the Christian Bible and the teachings of Marcus Garvey. They believe that a pre-Event emperor from "Zion" known as Ras Tafari was the representative of Jah, or God, on Earth, and that "the Event" was the result of Jah overthrowing the wicked forces of "Babylon", allowing the world to start anew. The Rasta faith is divided into several groups, or "mansions", and the two largest Rasta Mansions in the post-apocalyptic world are Bobo Ashanti and the Twelve Tribes of Israel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

archipelagic;Archipelagic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
archipelagic_DESC;Within the Communities of the Archipelagic Rites, exists an uneasy truce. The populace and the clergy are Particularists, loyal to the Patriarca. Despite this - and the warnings of heresy from the Particularist priests, the peasantry are known to seek the services of the Brujos, men of magic, who command fear and respect from the common folk. In exchange for wealth, sheep or family members, the Brujos perform their supernatural rituals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jehovah;Jehovah's Witness;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jehovah_DESC;Based on the teachings of the Bible Student movement and the apocalyptic legacy of the Millerites, the Jehovah's Witnesses are a millenarian nontrinitarian Protestant denomination that spread to South American from the north. They believe that Armageddon is imminent, and the establishment of God's kingdom over earth is the only solution for all problems faced by humanity. Jehovah's Witnesses are known for their door-to-door preaching, and they have a small presence in almost every corner of the known world. Jehovah's Witnesses reject trinitarianism, inherent immortality of the soul, and hellfire, which they consider to be unscriptural doctrines. They do not observe Christmas, Easter, birthdays or other holidays and customs they consider to have pagan origins incompatible with Biblical scripture. Jehovah's Witnesses consider human society to be morally corrupt and under the influence of Satan, and as a result, they shun interaction with non-Witnesses and politics in general. Since the Deluge, the Jehovah's Witnesses have become accepting of participation in politics, albeit in line with their their own theocratic beliefs, to establish God's kingdom over the Earth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

###End Game Screens
DYN1_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Belchioringia the Wild Hearts of the Nordeste.\nIn the waning days of the reign of Empress Fátima de Pelourinho, Antônio Carlos Belchior was a local commander in Ceará and a member of the Cearense aristocracy. Belchior initially fought under Fátima’s banner, stationed in Pernambuco, but the Empress’s death, the following Regency, and the resulting civil wars sparked by the Sertanejo led to Belchior taking the opportunity to seize his own destiny. Belchior and his troops mutinied in 2353, and they quickly overran Pernambuco. Belchior’s rebellion quickly picked up steam, and with the Regency in Bahia unable to quickly aid its Governorates, Belchior conquered Cabo Norte as well in 2354. Soon after, Antônio Carlos Belchior led an army against an invasion force from Bahia and defeated them at the Battle of Cabrobó in 2355, breaking the power of the Regency and detaching most of the Northeast from House de Pelourinho. The same year, Belchior declared himself Emperor of Belchioringia, a stark rebuke to the Regency. Most of the rest of Belchior’s reign was spent conquering his home region Ceará, whose aristocracy despised him to personal animosity. As a result, Belchior replaced the existing Cearense aristocracy with his own loyalists and subjugated the remainder of the Northeast. During his rule, Belchior would favor the coastal Atlanticanos leading to resentment from the Sertanejo and the Cearense. After the death of Belchior in 2362, the Empire of Belchioringia split into three pieces between Belchior’s sons. The Ceará Rebellion of 2366, led by the Seladite zealot Francisco Matildez, overthrew the middle brother Claudio, but House Belchioringio still retains a tight grip on the Northeast of Brazil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;xDYN2_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House von Habsburg. On the face of it, things were not looking very good for the Habsburg family in 1066. As minor Swiss counts, their status inside the Empire was fairly negligible compared to great territorial magnates of 11th century Germany. A policy of tactical marriages saw the family lands expand steadily, and it was during the chaos that gripped the Empire in the late 13h and early 14th century that the family were elected to the office of Holy Roman Empire. Although unable to hold the office they were able to use this a springboard to secure the Duchy of Austria for the dynasty. With this power base, the family would go on to dominate the politics of Central Europe until 1918.;Votre score est de $SCORE$ et vous pouvez le comparer avec celui de la Maison Habsbourg. À première vue, rien ne prédispose la famille Habsbourg au destin qui l'attend. Elle est composée de petits comtes suisses dont le statut est négligeable au sein de l'Empire comparé aux grands magnats de l'Allemagne du XIe siècle. Mais grâce à une habile stratégie matrimoniale, la famille accroît progressivement sa puissance territoriale et, pendant le chaos qui s'empare de l'Empire à la fin du XIIIe et au début du XIVe siècle, elle accède au trône du Saint-Empire romain germanique. Bien qu'évincée du pouvoir, la dynastie parvient à conserver le Duché d'Autriche et continue à dominer la politique de l'Europe centrale jusqu'en 1918.;Mit einem Punktestand von $SCORE$ habt Ihr$FAILED$ das Haus der Habsburger übertroffen. Oberflächlich betrachtet sah es für die Familie der Habsburger nicht gut aus: Als schweizerische Kleinadlige war ihr Status im Reich im Vergleich zu den großen territorialen Magnaten im Deutschland des elften Jahrhunderts ziemlich unerheblich. Durch taktische Heiraten erweiterte die Familie ihren Landbesitz kontinuierlich, und während des Chaos des ausgehenden 13. und beginnenden 14. Jahrhunderts wurde sie an die Spitze des Heiligen Römischen Reiches gewählt. Obwohl sie dieses Amt nicht halten konnte, so verstand sie es doch als Sprungbrett zur Sicherung des Herzogtums Österreichs für die Dynastie zu nutzen. Von dieser Machtbasis aus sollten die Habsburger die Politik Mitteleuropas bis 1918 dominieren.;;Con una puntuación de $SCORE$ tú, $FAILED$, no has logrado vencer a la Casa de Habsburgo. No parece que las cosas le vayan muy bien a la familia Habsburgo. Como condes suizos de segundo orden, su estatus dentro del imperio era bajo frente al de los grandes potentados de la Alemania del siglo XI. Una política de matrimonios estratégicos facilitó la expansión constante de las tierras de la familia, y fue durante el caos que se apoderó del imperio a finales del siglo XIII y principios del XIV cuando la familia fue elegida para el oficio del Sacro Imperio Romano Germánico. No lograron conservar el oficio, pero lo usaron como trampolín para hacerse con el ducado de Austria. Desde esta poderosa base, la familia dominaría las políticas de Europa Central hasta 1918.;;;;;;;;;x
DYN2_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House de Pelourinho the New Emperors of Brazil.\nLiberator! Savior! Deliverer! These are but a few names for Empress Fátima de Pelourinho, the woman that many call the first emperor of Brazil following the Event. Between the Event and Fátima, there was no Brazil. Instead, there was the Years of Lead where evil warlords of many types ruled the different regions of Brazil like petty kings in constant warfare with one another. Fátima’s parents were peasant leaders from Salvador in Bahia who rose up against these warlords, known as the Confederation of the Prosperous, only to be killed at the Battle of Propriá along with their son, with Fátima being the only survivor of the family. Fátima would take up her parents’ cause and would eventually return to defeat the Confederation, uniting Bahia and declaring the rebirth of the Brazilian Empire in 2323. She would rule for thirty years and campaign further north to Ceará and west to Brasília, slaying a cannibal Prophet-King in the streets of Brasília. Although she was Candomblé, Fátima was a tolerant ruler and minimized sectarian tensions under her rule, particularly between members of various Afro-Syncretic religions and Christian churches.After Fátima’s death, the fortunes of House de Pelourinho declined in turn as her son was put under a turbulent Regency, and their territory receded back to Bahia with their claim to Brazil becoming less and less credible, especially after the rise of the Belchioringians. Tristão I was finally coronated in 2368 however, and his ascension may represent either the fall of the Empire, or its resurgence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN3_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Desterro the Conquerors of Coffee and Milk.\nHouse Desterro, the traditional rulers of Minas, has its origin in the Serra da Mantiqueira, eventually conquering the south of Minas and assimilating into Canastros and its Benteiro fath. After this, Zé Desterro defeated the Bernardes clan who controlled Central Minas, and he founded the Kingdom of Minas in 2307. King Zé had many children by various concubines, and the kingdom expanded with the king handing out titles to his many progeny whose families assimilated to those locations. King Rodrigo I, Zé’s favored son, maintained peace within the family in Minas throughout his rule, but his ultimate goal was something greater: the conquest of São Paulo. Rodrigo I began his invasion of São Paulo and also invaded Uberlandia with the help of Evangelical mercenaries, spending much of his reign campaigning. Rodrigo I’s death in 2348 led to the coronation of his son, Rodrigo II, a man convinced of his own role as the Messiah who would end the chaos in Brazil, to build an empire to rival Fátima’s in Bahia. Rodrigo II invaded São Paulo the year after his coronation, and he left his relatives to govern Minas while he conquered. The entirety of São Paulo unified against Rodrigo II as he slowly conquered more and more territory, until he stood at the very gates of the city in 2362. That year, the lords of São Paulo finally laid down their arms and submitted to Rodrigo II, who declared himself the Empire of Coffee and Milk and the beginning of a new era in Brazil. However, the Prince William Jones of Americana refused to submit to Rodrigo II, and the new Emperor brought all his armies against the tiny realm. At the Battle of Americana in 2364, the bandeirante Alexandre Cantarini killed Rodrigo II and the Empire of Coffee and Milk was thrown into chaos, collapsing soon afterwards. House Desterro retained control of Minas, but its resulting ruler Mané was Rodrigo II’s dumb uncle who has no clear heir himself. Now, many worry that Mané’s death will throw Minas into civil war and possibly bring an end to House Desterro itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN4_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Ribamar the Fire Wasps.\nThe story of House Ribamar begins with a rebellion in the Kingdom of Maranhão by several noble families collectively known as the Fire Wasps. These nobles, followers of revelation of Saint Joachin de Fiori, opposed the Evangelical King José I Vitorino and his party, the Goats, and the Fire Wasps were led by José Ribamar, a former mercenary who sought to elevate his own station. The rebellion, beginning in 2345, lasted four years and devastated Maranhão. The death of José I Vitorino led to a compromise between the Goats and Fire Wasps, where José II Ribamar became the new king of Maranhão and the Vitorinos were allowed to retain their lands in Parnaíba Poente. After becoming king, José II organized an expedition to conquer Amapá, with the intention of furthering his control over the trade with the Caribbean. Ruled by four Jewish families, Amapá was quickly on the backfoot as José II pushed further west. Simão Peres, the impromptu military leader of the Amapaense Jews, quickly organized the resistance, and forced a stalemate until the Battle of Flechal River in 2361 when José II killed the Duke of Amapá after taking terrible wounds, accepting the submission of Simão Peres. After the costly victory over the Amapaense, José II sought to conquer the great city of Belém, however his wounds caught up with him and his reign was cut short in 2367. On his deathbed, José II divided his realm between his three children: his daughter Rosa got the Kingdom of Maranhão, his older son Zacarias got the Duchy of Amapá, and his younger son Francisco only got the country of Imperatriz. Furious, Francisco gathered the old guard of the Fire Wasps to Imperatriz, where he plans to take what is his by whatever means necessary, and House Ribamar looks to be on the brink of civil war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN5_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Valle the Protectors of Sovereignty.\nEven before the Event, Argentina desired above all else two things: stability and sovereignty. Both were lost in Argentina due to the chaos of the Event, with Buenos Aires in particular suffering due to a constant mix of warlords, raiders, and pirates. It was not until fairly recently that stability and sovereignty were restored under the first Valle king who drove out the pirates and subdued every warlord in Buenos Aires, both the city and province. House Valle, adherents to the Platinean state cult, were initially quite accommodating to their Christian subjects out of necessity due to the presence of the Patriarch of South America in Buenos Aires, and Buenos Aires prospered due to increased stability and trade. However, strife between the kings and patriarchs increased over the generations until the reign of Estanislao Valle, who finally expelled the Patriarch over his political intrigues and his refusal to excommunicate the king’s enemies. As a result, the Platine Crusade was called by the Patriarch of South America against Estanislao in 2358, and the king was forced to fight the crusader army, smashing the crusaders outside the city of Buenos Aires in 2366. After the decisive victory over the crusaders, House Valle stands stronger than ever, the sovereignty of Platineans now secure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN6_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Cavalcanti the Spirit Kings of Triângulo.\nThe history of House Cavalcanti goes back to the Years of Lead in Brazil when warlords ravaged Triângulo. The Kardecists of Triângulo were often victims of persecution by these warlords, and Mário Cavalcanti, a charmer and a wanderer, decided to stand up for a Kardecist woman under assault by warlord mercenaries. Thrown into the wilderness, Mário became an outlaw and eventually pushed the warlords out of Triângulo, becoming a Kardecist and declaring himself the King of Triângulo. For almost two hundred years, House Cavalcanti held onto Triângulo and fought off their neighbors in Minas and São Paulo. The last Cavalcanti ruler of Triângulo, Queen Maria Cavalcanti, was forced into a marriage to her vassal Marquis Fernando Villela to win his support against invaders from Minas. Maria and Fernando’s arranged marriage would blossom into genuine affection, and they would produce a son, Chico, who would inherit the kingdom upon Maria’s death in 2322 and bring an end to House Cavalcanti’s rule in Triângulo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN7_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Valdivieso the Crusader Kings of Chile.\nThe Kingdom of Chile was founded in 2322 by Augusto Valdivieso after his conquest of Santiago, most of Central Chile, and most of the Chilean coastline. King Augusto’s Particularist faith led him to war against Evangelicals and Mapuche in the south and Camino Estelar rulers in the north. This eventually led to pushback by Chile’s enemies in the south and the north, and the kingdom’s borders solidified by 2330. Augusto’s successor Charles I continued his father’s wars in the north while his ambitious vassal Duke Manuel Naranjo of Maule slowly accumulated power in the south and plotted against his king. Manuel started the Black Rebellion against Charles I in 2358 simultaneous to the declaration of the Platine Crusade, leading to his excommunication. Manuel managed to kill Charles I at the Battle of Linares in 2359, but the Black Duke was later killed in battle against the king’s successor, Charles II, in 2361. Soon after defeating Manuel, Charles II answered the call of the Platine Crusade by the Patriarch of South America and became a crusader. King Charles II Valdivieso, Count Alfonso Gelly, Duke Evaristo Uriburu, and Duke Domingo Holgado all joined together to lead the Platine Crusade, but the election of Charles II’s uncle to the Patriarch of South America in Santiago led to the king returning to his kingdom to secure his throne for fear of being usurped. As a result, Charles II missed the Battle of Buenos Aires in 2366, and Chile has become the new refuge of the Particularist Patriarch, with tensions between Charles II and his uncle calming down. House Valdivieso continues to rule Chile, with several avenues for expansion especially with their newfound stranglehold over the Particularist Catholic Church.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN8_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Cardoso the Grand Dukes of Ribeira.\nHouse Cardoso has long been a regional power in São Paulo, holding the Grand Duchy of Ribeira since 2289 when its founder Martim Cardosa unified Ribeira under one ruler. Martim secured an alliance with the Republic of Grande São Paulo, with his son Cosme I marrying Elis Matarazzo in 2324 to make Grande São Paulo and Ribeira even closer allies. Grand Duke Cosme I came to his allies' aid to fight off the invasions of Rodrigo I of Minas, but that led to his own death at the hands of Rodrigo I in 2337. Cosme I’s son, Cosme II, hated his father due to an incident that led to the death of his own wife and threw in his lot with Minas, first with Rodrigo I then Rodrigo II, against São Paulo. In this way, Cosme II hoped to destabilize the entire region and lead his own eventual ascendance. Cosme II remained an ally of Minas until Rodrigo II’s death at the Battle of Americana in 2348, a battle where Cosme II was horrifically scarred in a duel with Alexandre Cantarini shortly before Rodrigo II’s death. Following the Battle of Americana, Cosme II became a pariah among other Aparecidan rulers and was excommunicated by the church. Cosme II’s brooding and rage eventually even drove away his own son, Lucas, and the two are now rivals, both seeing one another as traitors to their own family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN9_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Holguín the Defenders of the Traditional Rite\nHouse Holguín is a relative newcomer to royalty, but it has had an immense impact on the land of Ecuador, unified for the first time since the Event. Founded by two brothers, Escrivá and Carlos, House  Holguín formed a pact with one another and city of Quito in 2345 to drive out foreign occupiers: the Army of the Commoners of Gran Colombia from the north, Inkarri in the east, and Liberationist heretics in the south. Devout Tridentines, the Holguín brothers gained the acceptance of the local nobility and scored several notable victories against the Army of Commoners, the last being at the Battle of Esmeraldas in 2349. The same year, Escrivá gathered the nobility in Quito and was coronated King of Ecuador with Carlos standing at his side. The Kingdom of Ecuador was in a state of constant war even after this coronation, with the Inkarri and the Army of Commoners invading later in Escrivá’s reign. Escrivá was run out of Quito by the Army of the Commoners in 2364, and the next year a madman claiming to be a new Pope claimed Quito for himself, fending off attempts by the Kingdom of Ecuador and the Army of the Commoners to retake the city. With the death of Carlos in 2368, Escrivá has become vengeful against his enemies, and House  Holguín looks to reclaim Quito, their home city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN10_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Ataucusi the Prophets of the New Universal Pact\nAccording to the Israelites, the history of House Ataucusi goes back to before the Deluge itself. Their founder, Ezequiel Ataucusi, declared himself to be the Christ of the west and the prophet of the New Universal Pact. Leading his followers into the Amazon, Brother Ezequiel declared that the end of the world was nearing and would preach that he had personally delayed such end-of-the-world events. Indeed, Brother Ezequiel’s death only preceded the Deluge by a few years, and Israelites take the timing as vindication of his prophecies. With its syncretic message of Incan mysticism and Biblical fundamentalism, the New Universal Pact gained many new converts as the world began to fall apart. The prophet’s descendants, prophets themselves by hereditary right, expanded the territory of the New Universal Pact throughout the Amazon and Peru in the years immediately following the Deluge, but the Israelites and their prophet were eventually beaten back at the gates of Lima and Manaus, both in the space of five years in 2103 and 2108. Since then, House Ataucusi have remained prophets of the New Universal Pact, but their territory has receded to its original stronghold on the banks of the Amazon, a shadow of their former strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN11_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House de Aguiar the Guardians of São Paulo\nThe history of House de Aguiar and São Paulo are deeply intertwined, going back all the way to the Years of Lead. Israel de Aguiar was the first Paulistano warlord to unite São Paulo under one ruler, and he secured the environs of Aparecida in the run-up to the Council of Aparecida of 2190, becoming an early important patron of the Aparecidan Catholic Church following the schism between the Particularists and Aparecidans. Following Israel’s death, his successor, Conte abolished military rule and returned to republicanism, eventually leading to House de Aguiar losing control of São Paulo to House Matarazzo after Conte’s death in 2213. House de Aguiar retained control of Sorocaba however until 2244 when a Liberationist rebel named Luis Cabanas seized control of Sorocaba after a famine ravaged the region. For a few generations, House de Aguiar remained in exile until Tobias de Aguiar, in a stroke of incredible good luck, retook Sorocaba in 2319. House de Aguiar has retained control of Sorocaba since then, and Diogo de Aguiar has reestablished contact with Grande São Paulo, forming an non-aggression pact with the city-state due increased interest in the land of his ancestors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN12_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House de Sarak the Witch Kings of Cordoba\nFollowing the Event, Argentina was thrown into chaos like much of the rest of the world. This was the world where Rama de Sarak, magician and world traveler, emerged from. Rama arrived in Cordoba in 2050, claiming to have arrived from across the World Ocean, and he performed many miracles, claiming to the people of Cordoba that they were not living in the End Times but in fact were witnessing a new beginning. He foretold that the Sixth Root Race would emerge in Cordoba, and that it was his mission to begin the intensive selective breeding program that would facilitate the conception of the Sixth Root Race. Rama’s Theosophist followers would soon grow to dominate Cordoba, and he became the first Witch King, Rama I. House de Sarak would rule Cordoba for more than two hundred years following Rama I. Their rule over Cordoba would finally come to an end when King Charles II of Chile and his crusaders decided to destroy the kingdom on their return route from the Platine Crusade. After Cordoba was besieged and taken in 2363, the last Witch King was dragged from his palace and dissolved in a boiling cauldron while his family barely escaped the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_30018;The story of Klaus de Aguirre is one of madness and folly, a timeless tale of the lush but unforgiving Amazonian jungle. Setting out from Lima with his family and a larger expedition, Klaus was in search of the fabled country of El Dorado. The original leader of the expedition, Gonzalo de Ursúa, wanted to turn back after much of their supplies were lost in an eddy, but Klaus led a mutiny to forge deeper into the Amazon: Cortés won an empire in Mexico by disobeying orders after all! Klaus proved to be an oppressive and terrifying leader, consumed by his mad desire to find El Dorado. After the expedition was destroyed by attacks and starvation, it was whittled down to just him and his daughter. Klaus, driven past the point of madness, decided to abandon his quest to find El Dorado and instead settle down in the Amazon Rainforest with a new goal: conquering all of America and founding an incestuous dynasty to rule over it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
