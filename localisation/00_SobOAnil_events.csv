chl.1.t;The Legacy of the Lion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chl.1.d;It has been a year since my father has died, I now stand at a crossroad on what to do with my life and how to live up to his legacy. I have received a letter of help from Miguel Cerezas, Duke of Coquimbo, asking for help in dealing with the Witch of Salamanca, he promises to bend his knee to me if I help him with the Witch and he also asks for a marriage pact between my son and his daughter and that his brother recieves Choapa. Meanwhile I have also received news of raiding Huaso bands led by Bartolo “el Roto” Lara, Duke of Maule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chl.1.a;I will help Coquimbo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chl.1.b;I will fight El Roto.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chl.1.c;Actually, I am fine as it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chl.2.t;The fate of the Witch of Salamanca;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chl.2.d;After a succesful campaign you’ve brought the Witch down, now she stands before you, begging for mercy, claiming that she will repent for her sins and promise absolute loyalty towards you, even offering her daughter for your son to marry to seal the deal. You are tempted, her daughter is very capable but you have also made promises to the Cerezas, what do you choose?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chl.2.a;God forgives, I do not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chl.2.b;God forgives and so do I.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
calafatist.1.t;The Embrace of the Cold;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
calafatist.1.d;You never thought this moment would arrive, but it has, as you turn your head to see how far away from your home you are, you know this is it.\nAs night begins to fall, the cold turns ever-present, your stomach is empty and your mouth is dry, you spend your last cold moments, remembering everything you have been through, and contemplating the wondrous beauty of the wild.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
calafatist.1.a;And you open your arms for the embrace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
calafatist.2.t;A Noble Sacrifice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
calafatist.2.d;You always thought it would happen someday, but finally, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has done it, the ultimate sacrifice, as the goddess once did.\nNow, while [From.GetHerHis] memory will always be blessed by this pious act, the grace of this noble act falls upon you, as prosperity awaits in reward for [From.GetHerHis] sacrifice, and now it is your turn to begin your rule solemnly, the same way as [From.GetSheHe] rule ended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
calafatist.2.a;We'll remember your sacrifice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
calafatist.3.t;The Calafate Harvest;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
calafatist.3.d;Every summer, the faithful go and look for the goddess' ever-present gift, the calafate berries. It's in their sweet and delicate taste, in the life-giving flesh of the fruit, that we find our goddess and our faith incarnated. As the most prominent rite we express our faith in, it's truly a moment to show everyone our devotion, costly as the harvests might be in effort some times. While eating the harvested fruit fresh is a great gift, many choose to store the berries, as the gift of the goddess persists as long as they are good to eat, and consuming it in difficult times is a way to gain strength to survive another day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
calafatist.3.a;We'll enjoy the gift of the goddess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
calafatist.3.b;Her blessing might be needed later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.6.t;The Brotherhood Reborn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.6.d;When the first brothers and sisters found the path of the stars ages ago, they set to follow the example of the Elder Siblings and Master Nibiru, and joined together in a Stellar Brotherhood of the true path, guided by an illuminated Master, who lead and presided over all the matters of the faith.\nFor ages since then, our people have sought guidance in the stars and found the rebirth of the Brotherhood under a Master as the next step in the path, yet we remained without a guide nor protector against those who obscure the light.\nBut now, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has shown us the light once again, and declaring [From.GetHerselfHimself] as Master of a reborn Stellar Brotherhood in the Earth, is ready to guide and strengthen the faith, as we advance in the next step through the path of the Elder Siblings, bringing us closer to fulfilling the Celestial Instructions than ever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.6.a;This all, was written in the stars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.9.t;The Path in the Stars;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.9.d;You set yourself in position to read the night sky for answers, your traditional equipment all set and ready for the most important rite for the followers of the Star Path, or Camino Estelar.\n\nYou set your sight through the scope, ready to find whatever plan has the Master Nibiru set for you, and what step must you follow, as you concentrate and begin to seek the message hidden in the stars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.9.a;I believe in [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]'s path for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.10.t;A Path of Conquest;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.10.d;As you focus on finding the path, suddenly the celestial instructions are clear in their intention, and the Elder Siblings in their distant wisdom have revealed to you the next step in the star path.\n\nYou shall conquer the land of [prophesied_province.GetName], for this is what you have read in the stars. It's time to fulfill your destiny, and prove the prophecy to be true.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.10.a;This is what the stars desire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.11.t;Prophecy Fulfilled;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.11.d;With the land of [prophesied_province.GetName] now firmly under your control, it seems that your reading was true. While many might have once before doubted you, you have fulfilled the path that the stars gave you, and your star-reading skills grow respected amongst the true believers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.11.a;Nibiru's plan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.12.t;Prophecy Failed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.12.d;As times passes by, many have noticed how the reading you had of the stars desiring you to conquer [prophesied_province.GetName] has not come true. While no one might doubt the Annunaki's grace, it seems that fate this time was not in your side, as even your own devotion has come into question.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.12.a;Did I misunderstand the stars?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.13.t;A Path of Peace;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.13.d;As you focus on finding the path, suddenly the celestial instructions are clear in their intention, and the Elder Siblings in their distant wisdom have revealed to you the next step in the star path.\n\nYour realm is to enjoy a period of peace and prosperity in the horizon, and nothing should stop this from happening, for this is Nibiru's intention. It's time to relax and share the peace with your realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.13.a;This is what the stars desire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.14.t;Prophecy Fulfilled;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.14.d;As time passes, people have enjoyed the peace and tranquility in the realm, and while the future is yet to be read, they know they can trust you in guiding them through the steps of the path, for you have the blessing of the Annunaki.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.14.a;Just as foretold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.15.t;Prophecy Failed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.15.d;As war and violence threaten our realm, the prophecy has become unfulfilled, for the peace that you foretold has not come, but conflict instead. It's as if whatever the stars told you, peace was not what they meant, and now people have lost faith in your connection to the Elder Siblings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.15.a;Did I misunderstand the stars?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.16.t;A Path of Family;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.16.d;As you focus on finding the path, suddenly the celestial instructions are clear in their intention, and the Elder Siblings in their distant wisdom have revealed to you the next step in the star path.\n\nYou will be not be alone anymore, as a partner, a spouse, will appear in your life, and not only that, but for a child will, fruit of your loins, blood of your blood, will be part of it all. This family is your future and the next step in the path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.16.a;A gift foretold by the stars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.17.t;Prophecy Fulfilled;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.17.d;As you contemplate your family now by your side, you have realized the prophecy written in the stars, of forming a family, has come true. It seems everything is coming to you as planned, and your connection to the Elder Siblings is proven to be righteous and fruitful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.17.a;Just as foretold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.18.t;Prophecy Failed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.18.d;As time passes by, the family you once saw in the stars has not arrived as it was shown to you. While life might not be so bad, it seems that either the path you saw in the stars wasn't right, or you failed the stars and strayed away from it. Your righteousness and devotion to the stars has come into question, because of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.18.a;Did I misunderstand the stars?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.19.t;A Death in the Path;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.19.d;As you focus on finding the path, suddenly the celestial instructions are clear in their intention, and the Elder Siblings in their distant wisdom have revealed to you the next step in the star path.\n\nA dark vision is in sight, as you see that within a year from tonight, [prophesied_to_die.GetFullName] will draw [prophesied_to_die.GetHerHis] last breath. While you never expected for such an outcome of your reading, this is the will of the stars, and even if you'd decide to be against this, you can't challenge Nibiru's will, for this fate must be fulfilled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.19.a;The stars shine darkly tonight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.20.t;Prophecy Fulfilled;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.20.d;As the news of [prophesied_to_die.GetFullName]'s name spread, the dark path you saw in the stars has happened as you predicted, and while some might doubt why this fate was written, no one can doubt that it was you who the Annunaki trusted the truth with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.20.a;A dark step was taken.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.21.t;Prophecy Failed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.21.d;As the year passes, [prophesied_to_die.GetFullName] has remained alive still, against the future you read in the stars. While [prophesied_to_die.GetSheHe] for sure might be glad, this only proves that, luckily for [prophesied_to_die.GetHerHim], your reading was false, or incorrect at least, and many wonder why would you claim such dark prophecies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.21.a;Did I misunderstand the stars?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.22.t;A Path of Friendship;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.22.d;As you focus on finding the path, suddenly the celestial instructions are clear in their intention, and the Elder Siblings in their distant wisdom have revealed to you the next step in the star path.\n\nYou set your sight on yourself. But not like now, a new companion, not romantic, but rather a friend, will arrive at your life, to be with you when you need them. It seems like a bright path awaits you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.22.a;The stars created friendship itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.23.t;Prophecy Fulfilled;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.23.d;With a new friend in your life, you have come to realize the prophecy you once read in the night sky has turned true, and you couldn't be more glad of the fact it did, as you enjoy your newfound friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.23.a;A friend is like a sibling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.24.t;Prophecy Failed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.24.d;As time passes by, you can't help but notice the friendship you saw in the stars hasn't arrived. Perhaps all this time you weren't meant to have that kind of companionship in your life, but gloomy as it might be to know it hasn't come true, others can't help but feel disappointed in your own devotion, given your reading of the stars' will was wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.24.a;Did I misunderstand the stars?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.25.t;A Path of Expansion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.25.d;As you focus on finding the path, suddenly the celestial instructions are clear in their intention, and the Elder Siblings in their distant wisdom have revealed to you the next step in the star path.\n\nYou shall one way or another come to acquire the [prophesied_duchy.GetFullBaseName], for this is what the Elder Siblings have planned for you. It's time to fulfill your destiny, and prove the prophecy to be true.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.25.a;This is what the stars want.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.26.t;Prophecy Fulfilled;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.26.d;With the [prophesied_duchy.GetFullBaseName] now firmly under your rule, it seems that your prophetic reading was true. While many might have once doubted this prophecy the stars revealed, you have fulfilled the path that was written in them, and your devotion to the far gods and grace with them gains notoriety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.26.a;Just another step on the path..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.27.t;Prophecy Failed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.27.d;As times passes by, many have noticed how the reading you had of the Elder Siblings desiring you to acquire the [prophesied_duchy.GetFullBaseName] has not come true. While no one might doubt the Annunaki's grace and wisdom, yours truly can be, and it seems that fate this time was not in your side, as even your own devotion has come into question.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.27.a;Did I misunderstand the stars?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.28.t;A Path of Expansion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.28.d;As you focus on finding the path, suddenly the celestial instructions are clear in their intention, and the Elder Siblings in their distant wisdom have revealed to you the next step in the star path.\n\nYou shall one way or another come to acquire the [prophesied_kingdom.GetFullBaseName], for this is what the Elder Siblings have planned for you. It's time to fulfill your destiny, and prove the prophecy to be true.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.28.a;This is what the stars want.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.29.t;Prophecy Fulfilled;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.29.d;With the [prophesied_kingdom.GetFullBaseName] now firmly under your rule, it seems that your prophetic reading was true. While many might have once doubted this prophecy the stars revealed, you have fulfilled the path that was written in them, and your devotion to the far gods and grace with them gains prominence, and attracts the envy of many.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

camino.30.d;As times passes by, many have noticed how the reading you had of the Elder Siblings desiring you to acquire the [prophesied_kingdom.GetFullBaseName] has not come true. While no one might doubt the Annunaki's grace and wisdom, yours truly can be, and it seems that fate this time was not in your side, as even your own devotion has come into question, some even claiming you fabricated such ostentatious claims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.30.a;Did I misunderstand the stars?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.31.t;A Path of Expansion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.31.d;As you focus on finding the path, suddenly the celestial instructions are clear in their intention, and the Elder Siblings in their distant wisdom have revealed to you the next step in the star path.\n\nYou shall one way or another come to acquire the [prophesied_empire.GetFullBaseName], for this is what the Elder Siblings have planned for you. It's time to fulfill your great destiny, and prove one of the grandest prophecies to be true, as well as that Nibiru's favor is on your side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.31.a;My destiny come true.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.32.t;Prophecy Fulfilled;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.32.d;With the [prophesied_empire.GetFullBaseName] now firmly under your rule, it seems that your prophetic reading was true. While many might have once doubted this great prophecy the stars revealed, calling it ridiculous even, you have fulfilled the path that was written in them, and your great devotion to the distant gods and your grace with them gains legend, and attracts the envy and awe of many.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.32.a;Just another step on the path..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.33.t;Prophecy Failed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.33.d;As times passes by, many have noticed how the reading you had of the Elder Siblings desiring you to acquire the [prophesied_kingdom.GetFullBaseName] has not come true. While no one might doubt the Annunaki's grace and wisdom, yours truly can be, and it seems that fate this time was not in your side, as even your own devotion has come into question, some even claiming you fabricated such ostentatious claims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.33.a;Did I misunderstand the stars?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.34.t;A Path of Parenthood;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.34.d;As you focus on finding the path, suddenly the celestial instructions are clear in their intention, and the Elder Siblings in their distant wisdom have revealed to you the next step in the star path.\n\nYou see the gift of life coming into yours, a child, blood of your blood and spawn of your loins, finally come into this world. You realize this is what the stars have finally written for you after so many years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.34.a;A Little Sibling for us all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.35.t;Prophecy Fulfilled;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.35.d;With your child [your_new_child.GetFirstName] finally born into this world, you have come to understand how this was the step the gods in the stars planned for you all along, even if it came late into your path, this blessing was part of the plan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.35.a;A step long time coming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.36.t;Prophecy Failed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.36.d;As time passes by, and no child in your life, you have come to doubt if it will ever be possible, as everything seems to show the prophecy you once read in the stars was no true. Whether you did something wrong, or didn't read what was actually meant to happen, you don't understand what went wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.36.a;Did I misunderstand the stars?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.37.t;A Path of Love?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.37.d;As you focus on finding the path, suddenly the celestial instructions are clear in their intention, and the Elder Siblings in their distant wisdom have revealed to you the next step in the star path.\n\nYou see the caress of a lover, the rush of emotion, the excitement, all coming into your life. While you might not necessarily be ignorant to the joys of the heart and the flesh, there is no lover in your life to share them with right now, that is, unless that's what the stars intend for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.37.a;Love is but a domain of the gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.38.t;Prophecy Fulfilled;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.38.d;The rush, the heartbeats, the smiles, you can't get them out of your head. While you can't stop thinking of [your_new_lover.GetFirstName], a different thought passes through your mind. The prophecy you read time ago, it came true. And you couldn't be happier about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.38.a;Love's in the stars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.39.t;Prophecy Failed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.39.d;As time passes by, and no child in your life, you have come to doubt if it will ever be possible, as everything seems to show the prophecy you once read in the stars was no true. Whether you did something wrong, or didn't read what was actually meant to happen, you don't understand what went wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

camino.40.t;A Path of Wealth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.40.d;As you focus on finding the path, suddenly the celestial instructions are clear in their intention, and the Elder Siblings in their distant wisdom have revealed to you the next step in the star path.\n\nYou see prosperity and wealth coming into you, as you will amass great riches and become the envy of many.\n\n§YYou need to accumulate 500 gold to fulfill this prophecy.§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.40.a;The path shines bright as gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.41.t;Prophecy Fulfilled;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.41.d;You have recently attained good wealth, as with everything, you feel grateful to the gods for this blessing, as well as fulfilling the prophesied step you saw in your future time ago, showing everyone how devout and blessed you truly are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.41.a;I Thank the Siblings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.42.t;Prophecy Failed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.42.d;As time passes by, your coffers remain stale, not receiving the blessing you remember finding written for you in the night sky. While this is severely disappointing, this also has put your devotion to the gods in question in the eye of many.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.42.a;Did I misunderstand the stars?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.43.t;Without A Path To Find;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.43.d;You try to focus on finding the path, but while you keep concentrating and looking for anything the gods have left for you to find, you instead find nothing at all, failing to read the star path, and to understand your upcoming destiny, as only the overwhelming darkness between the stars catches your eyes, devouring your gaze completely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
camino.43.a;Damned [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName], what have you done to me?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cath.1.t;Crusaders Not;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cath.1.d;The Catholic attempts to reconquer the holy city of Buenos Aires in the form of the Platine Crusade, began as a tragedy, and ended as a farce. With their forces rooted out of Buenos Aires and afterwards from the Platine Littoral, they were forced north into the Guarani lands, where the combined crusader forces, establishing themselves in a Crusader State out of necessity, were forced to settle for peace.\n\nCompletely outed from the holy lands, coffers were emptied and blood was spilled for what is deemed a worthless venture no one desired. Now the Platine Crusade will be remembered as a mistake, and the Crusade Experiment will have to end, until we heal from the wounds of the first one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cath.1.a;Nec Vult Deus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_holy_spirit_encarnation_eva;After a lot of emotional preparation, with a clear mind, You are finally ready for Charisma and entering communion with God through the Holy Spirit.\n As the church cerimony procedes and guided by the Pastor, you feel more and more in touch with God. \n \n Through diligence and prayer, you fell a light entering and what you see becomes clear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

####Bureaucratic EVENTS#########################

EVTDESCIE1;I have just received an application to take the National Exam from [From.GetTitledFirstName]. As the Evaluator of Merit for [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName], it is my duty to either accept or deny each application.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE1;This application is fine enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBIE1;What even is this? [From.GetTitledFirstName] is totally unprepared!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCIE2;I have just finished reading your application to take the National Exam, and I have found it to be up to my standards. Please come to the Examination Center within the next month.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE2;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCIE3;I have just finished reading your application to take the National Exam, and I regret to inform your that it is not up to the high standards of the National Exam. You are welcome to write another application at any time, granted that you are prepared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE3;Disappointing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCIE4;Now that I am set to take the National Exam, I need to get myself prepared through rigorous study. I can start by choosing which subject I am to focus on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE4;Math — numbers seem to elude me when I'm dealing with the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBIE4;Language Arts — I am unable to read a book without slipping off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCIE4;Science — I cannot grasp all the calculations and long-winded essays.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDIE4;History — Reading about the old and gone bores me so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCIE5;Now that I know what I am to focus on, I can now plan out how much time I will study.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE5;Reading a few passages before bed will do enough for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBIE5;I shall take to the book instead of to the hunt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
study_well_TT;Take your studies serious, though you may get strained.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCIE5;Every free second I have must be used to put my nose in a book!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
study_hard_TT;Drown yourself in studies. A noble goal, however it might put unnecessary strain on your body and mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCIE6;I have finally finished my studies. Now I am ready to take the Exam.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE6;...I hope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLEIE7;The Examination Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCIE7;You arrive at the massive examination center, where [Root.Government.GetName] lords from all walks of life come to receive their certification. You enter, are greeted by the Evaluator of Merit, and are given a test packet and a place to sit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE7;Let me leave with the smile of a coyote, and not one of a lark.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLEIE8;Math Section;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCIE8;You open to the first section and see the equations pile up as you start to flip ahead. The numbers jump out at you like a cougar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE8;Lets hope I remember the formula to this one...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ie_skills_TT;Your skills will determine how many points you receive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBIE8;I think I wrote some equations inside my hanfu.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cheat_TT;Attempt to cheat to get a passing grade this section. This is a very high risk move.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ie_caught_TT;getting caught cheating;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ie_suceed_TT;slipping past the eyes of the evaluators;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLEIE9;Language Arts;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCIE9;You finally finish the Math portion, and get to Language Arts. Eyeing the syntax, grammar, and general style, it's obvious this was written by a Sacramentan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE9;Valleyan Grammars, don't fail me now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBIE9;I believe I still have some lose notes in my garments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLEIE10;Science;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCIE10;You get to the Science section of the Exam, and you skim over all the questions. Some of these terms you could have sworn to be names in a fantasy novel you read.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE10;I just need to get my head straight and see past the confusion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBIE10;Do I still have that theorem sheet in my inside pocket?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLEIE11;History;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCIE11;That Science part is now behind you, and you get to the History portion of the Exam. Regnal numbers, proper names, and events meet your eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE11;Any proud [Root.Religion.GetName] knows the history of Cali...er...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBIE11;I think I have a summary of Californian history in my... ahem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLEIE12;Bureaucracy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCIE12;Your days of recalling histories are over, at least for now. You have reached the final — and most difficult — section of the National Exam, the Bureaucratic Treatise. You must now write an essay on the laws governing the realm. At least you get to choose the specific subject.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE12;I am the ruler of this realm, I should know this! Do I know this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBIE12;Maybe I can take some "inspiration" from a paper I read.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCIE13;One of the evaluators in the room glanced over to your table and caught you red-handed. They has asked you to leave the premises, and has failed you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

attempttobribe_TT;Attempt to bribe the test taker into passing you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCIE14;As I write the last few words in my treatise, anxiety washes over me. One of the evaluators takes my Exam and informs me that it will take a few days for them to get back to me with my score. I am almost unable to wait that long.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE14;It will be finished in due time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCIE15;I have received the exam of [From.GetTitledFirstName], and now must go through and score it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE15;[From.GetSheHeCap] has passed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBIE15;[From.GetSheHeCap] has failed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLEIE16;National Exam Rank;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCIE16;I have just received a letter from [From.GetTitledFirstName], congratulating me for passing the National Exam with a score of [Root.test_score.GetValue], and officially granting me a rank, according to my score.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE16;I am now officially certified to rule my lands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCIE17;I have just received a letter from [From.GetTitledFirstName], informing me that I did not pass the National Exam as a I received a score of [Root.test_score.GetValue]. [From.GetSheHe] went on to state that I may retake the Exam, though at a fee.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE17;I knew I should have studied longer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBIE17;Maybe some gold will sway [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCIE18;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has sent a letter, requesting that I pass his Exam paper, along with a considerable amount of gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE18;The sound of the coins is too alluring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBIE18;I simply cannot sacrifice my integrity to make [From.GetHerHim] happy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCIE19;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has accepted my bribe and passed my Exam.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE19;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCIE20;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has refused to pass my Exam, though has decided to keep my "donation".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE20;Damn it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCIE21;As a [Root.Government.GetName] ruler, I must pass the National Exam to have legitimacy among both vassals and peers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE21;Hopefully I can pass, and pass soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCIE22;[From.GetTitledFirstName] informs me that [From.GetSheHe] has abdicated his throne to [From.GetHerHis] heir, due to [From.GetHerHis] failure to pass the National Exam.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE22;Hopefully the next ruler can actually pass the exams.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCIE23;Now that I am no longer a bureaucrat, it makes little sense for me to be chained to the National Exam system.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE23;No loss to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCIE25;You arrive at the massive examination center, where [Root.Government.GetName] lords from all walks of life come to receive their certification. You enter, are greeted by the Evaluator of Merit, and are given a test packet and a place to sit.\nHowever, as you pore over page after page of the examination, you come to a harrowing conclusion — you don't know a single answer. How is this possible?! You studied so hard! The pressure builds up in your head as you come to understand just how pathetically stupid you truly are, until you can no longer take it, and begin to scream and cry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE25;I'm such a failure. I'm such a failure. I'm such a failure...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCIE26;You arrive at the massive examination center, where [Root.Government.GetName] lords from all walks of life come to receive their certification. You enter, and are shocked by how crowded the corridors are with people, all of them seemingly walking in the opposition direction that you are...\nYou push your way through the mass of people, and approach the Evaluator of Merit, who sits behind a massive stack of papers. The Evaluator gives you a strange look as you stand expectantly, waiting for your test. Finally, they speak up — "I'm sorry, [Root.GetName], but the examination has already ended. You are late. You failed.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE26;Late... no... this isn't possible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCIE27;You arrive at the massive examination center, where [Root.Government.GetName] lords from all walks of life come to receive their certification. You enter, are greeted by the Evaluator of Merit, and are given a test packet and a place to sit.\nAs you pore over page after page of the examination, you come to a harrowing conclusion — you don't know a single answer. How is this possible?! You quickly check the examination's date, and your mind immediately goes numb as you realize that all this time you had been studying for last year's examination... All those hours of studying were now wasted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE27;L-last year's examination... hahahahAHAHAHA;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCIE28;You arrive at the massive examination center, where [Root.Government.GetName] lords from all walks of life come to receive their certification. You enter, pick up a test packet, and find a place to sit.\nAs you begin going through the exam at a steady pace, you can feel the heavy stare of the Evaluator of Merit, along with several of your fellow test-takers. At first you were determined not to let it bother you, but it soon becomes too much and you snap. As you look around in anger, however, you quickly realize why they are staring at you... you are completely nude! The room erupts in laughter as you feebly attempt to cover yourself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE28;Naked...? How is this possible... my life, it's ruined!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCIE29;You shoot upright, cold sweat caking your body. You are in a delirium, and do not know where you are. As you struggle in the dark, however, you quickly come to realize that you're just in bed. Your bed? Oh... so it had all been a dream. Of course, you passed the National Exam long ago! There is no cause to worry about it now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAIE29;Even so, what a nightmare...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

bolivia.1.name;War or Wedding?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bolivia.1.desc;Bolivia sits on the edge of a knife, only a short time after its establishment. Founded as a place for the indigenous in memory of the legendary Tawantinsuyu and Plurinational State, the kingdom is far from a harmonious realm. Quechua and Aymara feud with one another, and the king’s own Aymara vassals openly speak of replacing him with one of their own. As you consider your next course of action, you are surprised by a visit by the Duchess of La Paz, dressed in rich silks and flanked by many attendants. The pomp does not cover her up her hideous features, a homely face framed by a monstrous nose. She offers a proposal to the King as the representative of the Aymara: marry her and share power or civil war. The proposal causes gasps and gags throughout the court: the King, with a woman like her?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_bolivia1;We will be wed then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_bolivia1;I will see you on the battlefield, not in bed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_apostolic_2;They are still heathens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

### CHARISMATIC EVENTS ###

# Joining Pastoral of Youth upon coming of age #
charismatic.1.d;As is tradition amongst Charismatic nobles, upon reaching 16 it is expected that one shall start partaking in Pastoral life by joining the Pastoral of the Youth, aimed at instructing its members and faith and readying them to later join one of the more specific pastorals. Pastoral of Youth activities often involve theological study and event organisation, but truthfully many just use the pastorals as excuses to socialize and meet potential brides.
charismatic.1.a;I will join it, as tradition demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
