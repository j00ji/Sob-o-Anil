DYN1_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Belchioringia the Wild Hearts of the Nordeste.\nIn the waning days of the reign of Empress Fátima de Pelourinho, Antônio Carlos Belchior was a local commander in Ceará and a member of the Cearense aristocracy. Belchior initially fought under Fátima’s banner, stationed in Pernambuco, but the Empress’s death, the following Regency, and the resulting civil wars sparked by the Sertanejo led to Belchior taking the opportunity to seize his own destiny. Belchior and his troops mutinied in 2353, and they quickly overran Pernambuco. Belchior’s rebellion quickly picked up steam, and with the Regency in Bahia unable to quickly aid its Governorates, Belchior conquered Cabo Norte as well in 2354. Soon after, Antônio Carlos Belchior led an army against an invasion force from Bahia and defeated them at the Battle of Cabrobó in 2355, breaking the power of the Regency and detaching most of the Northeast from House de Pelourinho. The same year, Belchior declared himself Emperor of Belchioringia, a stark rebuke to the Regency. Most of the rest of Belchior’s reign was spent conquering his home region Ceará, whose aristocracy despised him to personal animosity. As a result, Belchior replaced the existing Cearense aristocracy with his own loyalists and subjugated the remainder of the Northeast. During his rule, Belchior would favor the coastal Atlanticanos leading to resentment from the Sertanejo and the Cearense. After the death of Belchior in 2362, the Empire of Belchioringia split into three pieces between Belchior’s sons. The Ceará Rebellion of 2366, led by the Seladite zealot Francisco Matildez, overthrew the middle brother Claudio, but House Belchioringio still retains a tight grip on the Northeast of Brazil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN2_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House de Pelourinho the New Emperors of Brazil.\nLiberator! Savior! Deliverer! These are but a few names for Empress Fátima de Pelourinho, the woman that many call the first emperor of Brazil following the Event. Between the Event and Fátima, there was no Brazil. Instead, there was the Years of Lead where evil warlords of many types ruled the different regions of Brazil like petty kings in constant warfare with one another. Fátima’s parents were peasant leaders from Salvador in Bahia who rose up against these warlords, known as the Confederation of the Prosperous, only to be killed at the Battle of Propriá along with their son, with Fátima being the only survivor of the family. Fátima would take up her parents’ cause and would eventually return to defeat the Confederation, uniting Bahia and declaring the rebirth of the Brazilian Empire in 2323. She would rule for thirty years and campaign further north to Ceará and west to Brasília, slaying a cannibal Prophet-King in the streets of Brasília. Although she was Candomblé, Fátima was a tolerant ruler and minimized sectarian tensions under her rule, particularly between members of various Afro-Syncretic religions and Christian churches.After Fátima’s death, the fortunes of House de Pelourinho declined in turn as her son was put under a turbulent Regency, and their territory receded back to Bahia with their claim to Brazil becoming less and less credible, especially after the rise of the Belchioringians. Tristão I was finally coronated in 2368 however, and his ascension may represent either the fall of the Empire, or its resurgence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN3_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Desterro the Conquerors of Coffee and Milk.\nHouse Desterro, the traditional rulers of Minas, has its origin in the Serra da Mantiqueira, eventually conquering the south of Minas and assimilating into Canastros and its Benteiro fath. After this, Zé Desterro defeated the Bernardes clan who controlled Central Minas, and he founded the Kingdom of Minas in 2307. King Zé had many children by various concubines, and the kingdom expanded with the king handing out titles to his many progeny whose families assimilated to those locations. King Rodrigo I, Zé’s favored son, maintained peace within the family in Minas throughout his rule, but his ultimate goal was something greater: the conquest of São Paulo. Rodrigo I began his invasion of São Paulo and also invaded Uberlandia with the help of Evangelical mercenaries, spending much of his reign campaigning. Rodrigo I’s death in 2348 led to the coronation of his son, Rodrigo II, a man convinced of his own role as the Messiah who would end the chaos in Brazil, to build an empire to rival Fátima’s in Bahia. Rodrigo II invaded São Paulo the year after his coronation, and he left his relatives to govern Minas while he conquered. The entirety of São Paulo unified against Rodrigo II as he slowly conquered more and more territory, until he stood at the very gates of the city in 2362. That year, the lords of São Paulo finally laid down their arms and submitted to Rodrigo II, who declared himself the Empire of Coffee and Milk and the beginning of a new era in Brazil. However, the Prince William Jones of Americana refused to submit to Rodrigo II, and the new Emperor brought all his armies against the tiny realm. At the Battle of Americana in 2364, the bandeirante Alexandre Cantarini killed Rodrigo II and the Empire of Coffee and Milk was thrown into chaos, collapsing soon afterwards. House Desterro retained control of Minas, but its resulting ruler Mané was Rodrigo II’s dumb uncle who has no clear heir himself. Now, many worry that Mané’s death will throw Minas into civil war and possibly bring an end to House Desterro itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN4_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Ribamar the Fire Wasps.\nThe story of House Ribamar begins with a rebellion in the Kingdom of Maranhão by several noble families collectively known as the Fire Wasps. These nobles, followers of revelation of Saint Joachin de Fiori, opposed the Evangelical King José I Vitorino and his party, the Goats, and the Fire Wasps were led by José Ribamar, a former mercenary who sought to elevate his own station. The rebellion, beginning in 2345, lasted four years and devastated Maranhão. The death of José I Vitorino led to a compromise between the Goats and Fire Wasps, where José II Ribamar became the new king of Maranhão and the Vitorinos were allowed to retain their lands in Parnaíba Poente. After becoming king, José II organized an expedition to conquer Amapá, with the intention of furthering his control over the trade with the Caribbean. Ruled by four Jewish families, Amapá was quickly on the backfoot as José II pushed further west. Simão Peres, the impromptu military leader of the Amapaense Jews, quickly organized the resistance, and forced a stalemate until the Battle of Flechal River in 2361 when José II killed the Duke of Amapá after taking terrible wounds, accepting the submission of Simão Peres. After the costly victory over the Amapaense, José II sought to conquer the great city of Belém, however his wounds caught up with him and his reign was cut short in 2367. On his deathbed, José II divided his realm between his three children: his daughter Rosa got the Kingdom of Maranhão, his older son Zacarias got the Duchy of Amapá, and his younger son Francisco only got the country of Imperatriz. Furious, Francisco gathered the old guard of the Fire Wasps to Imperatriz, where he plans to take what is his by whatever means necessary, and House Ribamar looks to be on the brink of civil war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN5_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Valle the Protectors of Sovereignty.\nEven before the Event, Argentina desired above all else two things: stability and sovereignty. Both were lost in Argentina due to the chaos of the Event, with Buenos Aires in particular suffering due to a constant mix of warlords, raiders, and pirates. It was not until fairly recently that stability and sovereignty were restored under the first Valle king who drove out the pirates and subdued every warlord in Buenos Aires, both the city and province. House Valle, adherents to the Platinean state cult, were initially quite accommodating to their Christian subjects out of necessity due to the presence of the Patriarch of South America in Buenos Aires, and Buenos Aires prospered due to increased stability and trade. However, strife between the kings and patriarchs increased over the generations until the reign of Estanislao Valle, who finally expelled the Patriarch over his political intrigues and his refusal to excommunicate the king’s enemies. As a result, the Platine Crusade was called by the Patriarch of South America against Estanislao in 2358, and the king was forced to fight the crusader army, smashing the crusaders outside the city of Buenos Aires in 2366. After the decisive victory over the crusaders, House Valle stands stronger than ever, the sovereignty of Platineans now secure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN6_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Cavalcanti the Spirit Kings of Triângulo.\nThe history of House Cavalcanti goes back to the Years of Lead in Brazil when warlords ravaged Triângulo. The Kardecists of Triângulo were often victims of persecution by these warlords, and Mário Cavalcanti, a charmer and a wanderer, decided to stand up for a Kardecist woman under assault by warlord mercenaries. Thrown into the wilderness, Mário became an outlaw and eventually pushed the warlords out of Triângulo, becoming a Kardecist and declaring himself the King of Triângulo. For almost two hundred years, House Cavalcanti held onto Triângulo and fought off their neighbors in Minas and São Paulo. The last Cavalcanti ruler of Triângulo, Queen Maria Cavalcanti, was forced into a marriage to her vassal Marquis Fernando Villela to win his support against invaders from Minas. Maria and Fernando’s arranged marriage would blossom into genuine affection, and they would produce a son, Chico, who would inherit the kingdom upon Maria’s death in 2322 and bring an end to House Cavalcanti’s rule in Triângulo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN7_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Valdivieso the Crusader Kings of Chile.\nThe Kingdom of Chile was founded in 2322 by Augusto Valdivieso after his conquest of Santiago, most of Central Chile, and most of the Chilean coastline. King Augusto’s Particularist faith led him to war against Evangelicals and Mapuche in the south and Camino Estelar rulers in the north. This eventually led to pushback by Chile’s enemies in the south and the north, and the kingdom’s borders solidified by 2330. Augusto’s successor Charles I continued his father’s wars in the north while his ambitious vassal Duke Manuel Naranjo of Maule slowly accumulated power in the south and plotted against his king. Manuel started the Black Rebellion against Charles I in 2358 simultaneous to the declaration of the Platine Crusade, leading to his excommunication. Manuel managed to kill Charles I at the Battle of Linares in 2359, but the Black Duke was later killed in battle against the king’s successor, Charles II, in 2361. Soon after defeating Manuel, Charles II answered the call of the Platine Crusade by the Patriarch of South America and became a crusader. King Charles II Valdivieso, Count Alfonso Gelly, Duke Evaristo Uriburu, and Duke Domingo Holgado all joined together to lead the Platine Crusade, but the election of Charles II’s uncle to the Patriarch of South America in Santiago led to the king returning to his kingdom to secure his throne for fear of being usurped. As a result, Charles II missed the Battle of Buenos Aires in 2366, and Chile has become the new refuge of the Particularist Patriarch, with tensions between Charles II and his uncle calming down. House Valdivieso continues to rule Chile, with several avenues for expansion especially with their newfound stranglehold over the Particularist Catholic Church.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN8_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Cardoso the Grand Dukes of Ribeira.\nHouse Cardoso has long been a regional power in São Paulo, holding the Grand Duchy of Ribeira since 2289 when its founder Martim Cardosa unified Ribeira under one ruler. Martim secured an alliance with the Republic of Grande São Paulo, with his son Cosme I marrying Elis Matarazzo in 2324 to make Grande São Paulo and Ribeira even closer allies. Grand Duke Cosme I came to his allies' aid to fight off the invasions of Rodrigo I of Minas, but that led to his own death at the hands of Rodrigo I in 2337. Cosme I’s son, Cosme II, hated his father due to an incident that led to the death of his own wife and threw in his lot with Minas, first with Rodrigo I then Rodrigo II, against São Paulo. In this way, Cosme II hoped to destabilize the entire region and lead his own eventual ascendance. Cosme II remained an ally of Minas until Rodrigo II’s death at the Battle of Americana in 2348, a battle where Cosme II was horrifically scarred in a duel with Alexandre Cantarini shortly before Rodrigo II’s death. Following the Battle of Americana, Cosme II became a pariah among other Aparecidan rulers and was excommunicated by the church. Cosme II’s brooding and rage eventually even drove away his own son, Lucas, and the two are now rivals, both seeing one another as traitors to their own family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN9_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Holguín the Defenders of the Traditional Rite\nHouse Holguín is a relative newcomer to royalty, but it has had an immense impact on the land of Ecuador, unified for the first time since the Event. Founded by two brothers, Escrivá and Carlos, House  Holguín formed a pact with one another and city of Quito in 2345 to drive out foreign occupiers: the Army of the Commoners of Gran Colombia from the north, Inkarri in the east, and Liberationist heretics in the south. Devout Tridentines, the Holguín brothers gained the acceptance of the local nobility and scored several notable victories against the Army of Commoners, the last being at the Battle of Esmeraldas in 2349. The same year, Escrivá gathered the nobility in Quito and was coronated King of Ecuador with Carlos standing at his side. The Kingdom of Ecuador was in a state of constant war even after this coronation, with the Inkarri and the Army of Commoners invading later in Escrivá’s reign. Escrivá was run out of Quito by the Army of the Commoners in 2364, and the next year a madman claiming to be a new Pope claimed Quito for himself, fending off attempts by the Kingdom of Ecuador and the Army of the Commoners to retake the city. With the death of Carlos in 2368, Escrivá has become vengeful against his enemies, and House  Holguín looks to reclaim Quito, their home city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN10_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Ataucusi the Prophets of the New Universal Pact\nAccording to the Israelites, the history of House Ataucusi goes back to before the Deluge itself. Their founder, Ezequiel Ataucusi, declared himself to be the Christ of the west and the prophet of the New Universal Pact. Leading his followers into the Amazon, Brother Ezequiel declared that the end of the world was nearing and would preach that he had personally delayed such end-of-the-world events. Indeed, Brother Ezequiel’s death only preceded the Deluge by a few years, and Israelites take the timing as vindication of his prophecies. With its syncretic message of Incan mysticism and Biblical fundamentalism, the New Universal Pact gained many new converts as the world began to fall apart. The prophet’s descendants, prophets themselves by hereditary right, expanded the territory of the New Universal Pact throughout the Amazon and Peru in the years immediately following the Deluge, but the Israelites and their prophet were eventually beaten back at the gates of Lima and Manaus, both in the space of five years in 2103 and 2108. Since then, House Ataucusi have remained prophets of the New Universal Pact, but their territory has receded to its original stronghold on the banks of the Amazon, a shadow of their former strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN11_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House de Aguiar the Guardians of São Paulo\nThe history of House de Aguiar and São Paulo are deeply intertwined, going back all the way to the Years of Lead. Israel de Aguiar was the first Paulistano warlord to unite São Paulo under one ruler, and he secured the environs of Aparecida in the run-up to the Council of Aparecida of 2190, becoming an early important patron of the Aparecidan Catholic Church following the schism between the Particularists and Aparecidans. Following Israel’s death, his successor, Conte abolished military rule and returned to republicanism, eventually leading to House de Aguiar losing control of São Paulo to House Matarazzo after Conte’s death in 2213. House de Aguiar retained control of Sorocaba however until 2244 when a Liberationist rebel named Luis Cabanas seized control of Sorocaba after a famine ravaged the region. For a few generations, House de Aguiar remained in exile until Tobias de Aguiar, in a stroke of incredible good luck, retook Sorocaba in 2319. House de Aguiar has retained control of Sorocaba since then, and Diogo de Aguiar has reestablished contact with Grande São Paulo, forming an non-aggression pact with the city-state due increased interest in the land of his ancestors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DYN12_DESC;With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House de Sarak the Witch Kings of Cordoba\nFollowing the Event, Argentina was thrown into chaos like much of the rest of the world. This was the world where Rama de Sarak, magician and world traveler, emerged from. Rama arrived in Cordoba in 2050, claiming to have arrived from across the World Ocean, and he performed many miracles, claiming to the people of Cordoba that they were not living in the End Times but in fact were witnessing a new beginning. He foretold that the Sixth Root Race would emerge in Cordoba, and that it was his mission to begin the intensive selective breeding program that would facilitate the conception of the Sixth Root Race. Rama’s Theosophist followers would soon grow to dominate Cordoba, and he became the first Witch King, Rama I. House de Sarak would rule Cordoba for more than two hundred years following Rama I. Their rule over Cordoba would finally come to an end when King Charles II of Chile and his crusaders decided to destroy the kingdom on their return route from the Platine Crusade. After Cordoba was besieged and taken in 2363, the last Witch King was dragged from his palace and dissolved in a boiling cauldron while his family barely escaped the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
